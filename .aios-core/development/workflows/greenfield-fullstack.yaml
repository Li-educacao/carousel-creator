    Agent workflow for building full-stack applications from concept to development.
    Supports both comprehensive planning for complex projects and rapid prototyping for simple ones.
    Includes Phase 0 environment bootstrap for proper tooling setup.
    Now with Squad Routing — automatically delegates to specialized squads (design-system,
    media-buy-squad, security-squad, mmos-squad) when domain keywords are detected.

        CRITICAL FIRST STEP - Run before any planning:
        - @devops → *environment-bootstrap
        - Verifies/installs CLIs (git, gh, node, supabase, railway)
        - Authenticates services (GitHub, Supabase, Railway)
        - Creates Git repository locally and on GitHub
        - Scaffolds AIOS project structure
        - Generates environment report

        SKIP CONDITIONS:
        - Only skip if project already has .aios/environment-report.json
        - Re-run if switching machines or team members join

      duration_estimate: "5-10 min"
      requires: sharded_docs
      notes: |
        CRITICAL STEP — Constitution Article VII (Squad First).

        Read .aios-core/config/squad-routing-rules.yaml and scan the PRD content
        for domain keyword matches. For each match, record which squad must be used.

        Process:
        1. Read squad-routing-rules.yaml → domain_routing patterns
        2. Scan PRD text against all domain patterns
        3. For each match, record: domain, squad, lead_agent
        4. Output a squad_manifest listing all squads needed for this project

        Example output:
        ```yaml
        squad_manifest:
          - domain: design
            squad: design-system
            lead: design-chief
            stories_affected: [1.2, 2.1, 3.1]
          - domain: marketing
            squad: media-buy-squad
            lead: ad-midas
            stories_affected: [1.1, 4.1, 4.2]
        ```

        If NO squads match → proceed with core agents only.
        If squads match → set target_context to "hybrid" for affected stories.
        Store manifest in .aios/{instance-id}-squad-manifest.yaml.

        DO NOT ask the user — this is automatic based on keyword scan.

        SQUAD-AWARE IMPLEMENTATION (Constitution Article VII):

        1. Check squad_manifest from scan-domain-routing step
        2. If this story matches a squad domain:
           - Use target_context: "hybrid"
           - Route to squad lead agent instead of generic @dev
           - Squad lead delegates to specialist agents
           - Example: design story → @design-chief → @brad-frost for tokens
           - Example: ads story → @ad-midas → @pixel-specialist for tracking
        3. If no squad match → use @dev as normal

        PARALLEL EXECUTION:
        - Stories from DIFFERENT domains CAN run in parallel (max 3)
        - Stories from SAME domain MUST run sequentially
        - Use Task tool with multiple calls for parallel stories

        Dev Agent (New Chat, squad-aware):
        - Implements approved story using squad specialists
        - Updates File List with all changes
        - Marks story as "Review" when complete
