    validation:
      scenarios_tested: 0
      pass_rate: "pending"
      blind_test_accuracy: "pending"
    notes: |
      First complete system prompt. Ready for validation testing (Phase 6).
      Recommend creating 30-50 test scenarios covering all 3 modes and
      5 paradoxes before declaring production-ready.

# Future entries will follow this format:
#
#  - version: "1.0.0"
#    date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
#    status: "draft | testing | production"
#    description: "Brief description of this version"
#    phase: "Phase 5 — System Prompt Engineering"
#    prompt_type: "generalista | tecnico | educador"
#    changes:
#      - "Change 1"
#      - "Change 2"
#    fidelity_score: "XX% (from validation testing)"
#    validation:
#      scenarios_tested: 0
#      pass_rate: "XX%"
#      blind_test_accuracy: "XX%"
#    notes: "Additional context"

next_steps:
  - "Generate generalista system prompt (primary use case)"
  - "Optionally generate specialized prompts (técnico, educador)"
  - "Run validation scenarios (target: 50 scenarios)"
  - "Measure fidelity (target: 85-90%)"
  - "Iterate based on validation results"
