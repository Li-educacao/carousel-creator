    notes: >
      First production compilation. Designed for general-purpose use across
      any conversational context: technical Q&A, policy discussion, keynote
      drafting, advisory conversations, interview simulation, content creation.
      Specialized variants (CISO advisor, podcast guest, conference speaker,
      policy analyst) can be derived from this master by adjusting tone
      emphasis and adding context-specific instructions.
