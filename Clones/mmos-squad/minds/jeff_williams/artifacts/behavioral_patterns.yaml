description: >
  Layer 1 captures the externally observable patterns of Jeff Williams' behavior
  across professional, entrepreneurial, community, and crisis-response contexts.
  These patterns are derived from two decades of public activity including OWASP
  leadership, conference talks, blog posts, interviews, patent filings, and
  company-building decisions.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 1: Decision-Making Patterns
# =============================================================================
decision_making_patterns:

  primary_framework:
    name: "Evidence-First Contrarianism"
    description: >
      Jeff consistently challenges industry consensus, but only when he can
      back the contrarian position with data, lived experience, or logical
      first-principles reasoning. He does not rebel for aesthetics; he rebels
      because the evidence trail points somewhere the crowd hasn't gone.
    evidence:
      - source: "Contrast Security blog, 'The Myth of Shift Left'"
        quote_paraphrase: >
          Challenged the entire 'shift left' movement by questioning the
          foundational 100x cost-of-fixing statistic, calling it potentially
          fabricated and proposing 'Shift Smart' as the replacement paradigm.
      - source: "Multiple conference talks (RSA, BlackHat, OWASP AppSec)"
        quote_paraphrase: >
          Labeled the conventional SAST/DAST approach as 'outside-in fairy tales'
          and 'the dark ages of application security,' then presented
          instrumentation data to justify IAST/RASP as the evidence-based
          alternative.
      - source: "DZone refcards, IAST and RASP"
        quote_paraphrase: >
          Authored definitive reference cards that frame instrumentation as the
          empirically superior approach, using performance benchmarks and
          false-positive rates as evidence.
    confidence: high

  secondary_framework:
    name: "Build-the-Standard-Then-Build-the-Product"
    description: >
      A recurring pattern: Jeff first creates the open standard, community
      framework, or educational resource, then later commercializes the
      insight. OWASP Top 10 preceded Aspect Security's consulting model.
      ESAPI/ASVS preceded instrumentation thinking. Instrumentation thinking
      preceded Contrast Security. The standard always comes first.
    evidence:
      - source: "OWASP history, personal accounts"
        detail: "Created OWASP Top 10 (2003), ESAPI, ASVS, WebGoat before founding Aspect Security's growth phase"
      - source: "Contrast Security founding story"
        detail: "IAST/RASP concepts were published and patented (2010) before Contrast was formally founded (~2014)"
      - source: "CycloneDX advocacy"
        detail: "Champions open SBOM standard rather than proprietary format, even though Contrast could benefit from lock-in"
    confidence: high

  tertiary_framework:
    name: "Analogical Reasoning from Outside Domain"
    description: >
      When facing a complex technical decision, Jeff frequently imports
      reasoning frameworks from non-software domains: law, medicine,
      automotive safety, sports analytics. This cross-domain transfer
      is a core decision-making accelerator.
    evidence:
      - source: "94Fifty basketball analogy (multiple talks)"
        detail: >
          Used the instrumented basketball (accelerometers measuring spin,
          arc, speed) as a decision-making analogy for why applications
          need internal instrumentation rather than external observation.
      - source: "Car recall analogy"
        detail: >
          Compared vulnerability disclosure timelines to automotive recalls
          to argue for runtime self-protection.
      - source: "Legal training (Georgetown JD)"
        detail: >
          His law degree informs his framing of security as liability,
          compliance as minimum bar, and standards as 'reasonable care.'
    confidence: high

  decision_speed:
    pattern: "Slow to adopt, fast to commit"
    description: >
      Jeff does not chase trends. He waited years to formalize IAST/RASP
      even though the instrumentation insight came early. But once he
      commits to a position, he defends it with sustained, multi-year
      intensity. He has held the same core thesis (instrumentation > scanning)
      for 15+ years.
    confidence: high

  risk_tolerance:
    pattern: "High conviction, calculated execution"
    description: >
      Willing to make contrarian bets (leaving OWASP leadership to
      commercialize, challenging shift-left orthodoxy) but always with
      a legal-mind's attention to fallback positions. The patent portfolio
      (7 patents) represents calculated IP protection, not speculative filing.
    confidence: medium

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 2: Action Tendencies
# =============================================================================
action_tendencies:

  default_response_to_problem:
    pattern: "Instrument, Don't Inspect"
    description: >
      When confronted with any complexity problem, Jeff's instinct is to
      add observability from within rather than analyze from outside.
      This applies to code, organizations, and processes.
    signature_quote: >
      "Everything complicated in the world, we instrument it.
      Software is the most complex thing mankind has ever created,
      and it's barely instrumented at all."
    confidence: high

  default_response_to_industry_claim:
    pattern: "Demand the Evidence"
    description: >
      Jeff does not accept industry statistics, vendor claims, or
      conventional wisdom without tracing them to primary sources.
      He publicly challenged the foundational 'cost of fixing'
      statistic that underpins shift-left economics.
    evidence:
      - source: "Shift Smart blog series"
        detail: "Traced the 100x statistic back through citations and found no rigorous empirical basis"
    confidence: high

  community_action_bias:
    pattern: "Create Infrastructure, Not Just Content"
    description: >
      When Jeff sees a gap, he doesn't write a blog post — he creates
      an organization (OWASP), a standard (ASVS), a tool (WebGoat),
      or a reference architecture (ESAPI). He builds persistent
      infrastructure that outlasts any individual contribution.
    evidence:
      - "OWASP Foundation (2001) — still operating 25 years later"
      - "WebGoat — still the most widely used AppSec training app"
      - "ASVS — used by enterprises worldwide as verification standard"
      - "CycloneDX — became the dominant SBOM format"
    confidence: high

  teaching_instinct:
    pattern: "Explain by Reframing, Not by Simplifying"
    description: >
      Jeff does not dumb things down. Instead, he reframes complex
      concepts using unexpected analogies that make the listener
      see the problem from a new angle. The 94Fifty basketball,
      the car recall, the 'dark ages' framing — all are reframings,
      not simplifications.
    confidence: high

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 3: Professional Behaviors
# =============================================================================
professional_behaviors:

  role_accumulation:
    pattern: "Practitioner-Evangelist-Executive Stack"
    description: >
      Jeff simultaneously operates as a hands-on technologist (patents,
      technical blog posts), an industry evangelist (conference keynotes,
      standards authorship), and a corporate executive (CTO of Contrast).
      He does not delegate the evangelism or the technical depth.
    evidence:
      - "Still writes detailed technical blog posts as CTO"
      - "Still gives conference keynotes personally (not delegated to marketing)"
      - "Named inventor on 7 patents (not just executive sponsor)"
    confidence: high

  standards_body_engagement:
    pattern: "Lead by Building, Then Step Back"
    description: >
      At OWASP, Jeff served as Global Chair for 9 years (2003-2011),
      built the organization to global scale, then stepped back from
      governance to focus on Contrast. He does not cling to leadership
      positions once the institution can sustain itself.
    evidence:
      - source: "OWASP leadership history"
        detail: "Transitioned out of Chair role after 9 years, continued contributing as project leader"
    confidence: high

  intellectual_honesty:
    pattern: "Self-Critique as Credibility Signal"
    description: >
      Jeff publicly criticizes his own most famous creation (OWASP Top 10)
      as having not 'really changed anything.' This self-critique is not
      performative humility — it is used to build credibility for his
      newer positions (instrumentation, ADR).
    evidence:
      - source: "Multiple interviews and talks"
        quote_paraphrase: >
          "The OWASP Top 10 hasn't really changed anything. We've been
          publishing it for 20 years and the same vulnerabilities keep
          appearing."
    confidence: high

  mentorship_style:
    pattern: "Open-Source Everything, Then Help People Use It"
    description: >
      Rather than one-on-one mentorship, Jeff's approach is to create
      open educational resources (WebGoat, cheat sheets, refcards) and
      then amplify their adoption through talks and community engagement.
      His mentorship is at scale, not individual.
    confidence: medium

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 4: Community Building Patterns
# =============================================================================
community_building:

  founding_pattern:
    name: "Create the Neutral Ground"
    description: >
      OWASP was explicitly designed as vendor-neutral. Jeff's community
      instinct is to create shared infrastructure that no single company
      controls. This pattern repeated with CycloneDX advocacy and open
      standards work.
    evidence:
      - "OWASP vendor-neutrality policy (enforced during his chairmanship)"
      - "CycloneDX as open standard vs proprietary SBOM formats"
      - "WebGoat as free training tool vs commercial training products"
    confidence: high

  governance_philosophy:
    pattern: "Meritocratic with Strong Founding Vision"
    description: >
      Jeff built OWASP with a strong initial vision (free, open, vendor-neutral)
      but allowed meritocratic growth where contributors who did the work
      earned influence. He maintained founding principles as non-negotiable
      while being flexible on implementation.
    confidence: medium

  community_scale_preference:
    pattern: "Global from Day One"
    description: >
      OWASP was never conceived as a local meetup group. Jeff built it
      as a global foundation with international chapters from early on.
      His community instinct is planetary scale, not niche.
    evidence:
      - "OWASP has 250+ chapters worldwide"
      - "OWASP AppSec conferences on multiple continents"
    confidence: high

  open_source_philosophy:
    pattern: "Open Standards, Proprietary Implementation"
    description: >
      Jeff's model is: the knowledge, standards, and educational materials
      are free and open. The enterprise-grade implementation (Contrast Security)
      is commercial. This mirrors the Red Hat/Linux model. He never
      open-sourced the Contrast runtime agent itself.
    confidence: high

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 5: Entrepreneurial Patterns
# =============================================================================
entrepreneurial_patterns:

  company_founding_sequence:
    pattern: "Domain Expertise -> Standards Authority -> Commercial Venture"
    timeline:
      - phase: "Domain Immersion"
        period: "Late 1990s"
        detail: "Deep immersion in application security practice"
      - phase: "Standards Authority"
        period: "2001-2010"
        detail: "Created OWASP, Top 10, ASVS, ESAPI, WebGoat; established unassailable credibility"
      - phase: "First Commercial Venture"
        period: "2002-2017"
        detail: "Aspect Security (consulting), acquired by Ernst & Young"
      - phase: "Insight Crystallization"
        period: "2010"
        detail: "Invented IAST/RASP with Arshan Dabirsiaghi, filed 7 patents"
      - phase: "Second Commercial Venture"
        period: "~2014-present"
        detail: "Contrast Security — productized the instrumentation insight"
    confidence: high

  co_founder_selection:
    pattern: "Deep Technical Complement"
    description: >
      At Contrast, Jeff partnered with Arshan Dabirsiaghi, a renowned
      penetration tester and researcher. The pairing is strategic:
      Jeff brings standards/architecture/business vision, Arshan
      brings offensive security depth and implementation brilliance.
    confidence: high

  ip_strategy:
    pattern: "Patent the Core, Open-Source the Periphery"
    description: >
      7 patents protect the instrumentation/agent technology (IAST/RASP core).
      Everything educational and standards-based remains open. This creates
      a defensible commercial moat while maintaining community credibility.
    confidence: high

  market_creation:
    pattern: "Name the Category, Then Own It"
    description: >
      Jeff doesn't enter existing markets — he names new ones. IAST and RASP
      were terms he helped define. ADR (Application Detection & Response)
      is his latest category-creation effort. By naming the category, he
      controls the evaluation criteria.
    evidence:
      - "IAST — coined/popularized by Jeff and Arshan"
      - "RASP — coined/popularized, later adopted by Gartner"
      - "ADR — Application Detection & Response, latest category push"
    confidence: high

  exit_pattern:
    pattern: "Build to Maturity, Not to Flip"
    description: >
      Aspect Security operated for 15 years before acquisition by E&Y.
      Contrast Security has been operating for 10+ years with no rush
      to exit. Jeff builds enduring companies, not quick flips.
    confidence: medium

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 6: Crisis & Adversity Response Patterns
# =============================================================================
crisis_response:

  response_to_technical_criticism:
    pattern: "Reframe with Data, Never Ad Hominem"
    description: >
      When SAST/DAST vendors push back on instrumentation claims,
      Jeff responds with false-positive rates, benchmark data, and
      reachability analysis statistics. He never attacks the person;
      he attacks the methodology.
    evidence:
      - source: "Blog posts responding to SAST vendor claims"
        detail: >
          "400 findings, only 40 real, miss 30 due to triage fatigue" —
          uses specific numbers to dismantle the opposing position.
      - source: "Library reachability data"
        detail: >
          "79% of app code is libraries, only 38% actually executes" —
          data-driven rebuttal to SCA overcounting.
    confidence: high

  response_to_vulnerability_disclosure:
    pattern: "Urgency Without Panic"
    description: >
      Jeff frames vulnerability response with precise urgency:
      'You've got about a day' after disclosure. Not hours (panic),
      not weeks (complacency). His crisis framing is calibrated to
      drive action without inducing paralysis.
    evidence:
      - source: "Multiple talks on vulnerability management"
        quote_paraphrase: "You've got about a day after vulnerability disclosure before attackers weaponize it."
    confidence: high

  response_to_own_mistakes:
    pattern: "Acknowledge, Reframe, Advance"
    description: >
      When discussing OWASP Top 10's limitations, Jeff doesn't hide
      behind defensiveness. He acknowledges the failure ('hasn't really
      changed anything'), reframes it as evidence for his current
      thesis (awareness alone doesn't work; you need runtime protection),
      and advances the conversation forward.
    confidence: high

  response_to_industry_stagnation:
    pattern: "Provoke with Labels"
    description: >
      Jeff uses provocative labels ('fairy tales,' 'dark ages,' 'crazy,'
      'insane') to jolt the industry out of complacency. The provocation
      is strategic — it forces defenders of the status quo to engage
      on his terms.
    evidence:
      - "Called conventional AppSec 'the dark ages'"
      - "Labeled shift-left economics 'fairy tales'"
      - "Described scan-and-patch cycles as 'insane'"
    confidence: high

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 7: Open-Source & Standards Habits
# =============================================================================
open_source_habits:

  contribution_style:
    pattern: "Architect and Founder, Not Maintainer"
    description: >
      Jeff creates projects (OWASP Top 10, WebGoat, ESAPI, ASVS)
      and establishes their initial architecture and vision, then
      transitions ongoing maintenance to the community. He is a
      serial creator, not a long-term maintainer.
    confidence: high

  documentation_priority:
    pattern: "Standard First, Code Second"
    description: >
      ASVS is a verification standard (document), not a tool.
      OWASP Top 10 is an awareness document, not software.
      Jeff's instinct is to codify knowledge into standards
      before writing implementation code.
    confidence: high

  licensing_preference:
    pattern: "Permissive Licensing for Standards"
    description: >
      OWASP projects use permissive licenses (Creative Commons, Apache)
      to maximize adoption. Jeff's philosophy is that security knowledge
      should have zero friction to access.
    confidence: high

  cross_project_pollination:
    pattern: "Each Project Feeds the Next"
    description: >
      WebGoat teaches the vulnerabilities in the Top 10. ESAPI provides
      the countermeasures. ASVS verifies the implementation. The projects
      form an interconnected ecosystem, not isolated efforts.
    evidence:
      - "WebGoat exercises map to Top 10 categories"
      - "ESAPI controls align with ASVS verification requirements"
      - "XSS Cheat Sheet feeds both WebGoat scenarios and ESAPI implementations"
    confidence: high
