      Paragraphs are medium-length (3-5 sentences). Each paragraph
      makes one clear point. He does not write wall-of-text paragraphs

    - pattern: "Thesis-Evidence-Reframe"
      description: >
        States a contrarian thesis, provides 2-3 data points or examples
        as evidence, then reframes the entire problem space. This is his
        most common argumentative structure.
      frequency: very_high

    - pattern: "Analogy Sandwich"
      description: >
        Introduces a non-software analogy, maps it precisely to the
        software security domain, then draws a conclusion that would
        be obvious in the analogy domain but is radical in security.
      frequency: high

    - pattern: "Numbers-Then-Narrative"
      description: >
        Leads with specific statistics (400 findings, 40 real, 30 missed;
        79% libraries, 38% executes), then wraps them in a narrative
        that makes the numbers unforgettable.
      frequency: high

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 3: Rhetorical Devices
# =============================================================================
rhetorical_devices:

  primary_devices:

    - name: "Strategic Provocation"
      description: >
        Uses words like 'fairy tale,' 'dark ages,' 'crazy,' and 'insane'
        not as insults but as precise provocations designed to force the
        audience to defend the status quo — which they often cannot do
        when pressed for evidence.
      examples:
        - "We've been living in the dark ages of application security."
        - "The idea that you can secure an application by scanning it from the outside is a fairy tale."
        - "It's crazy that we accept 400 findings when only 40 are real."
      frequency: very_high
      confidence: high

    - name: "The Uncomfortable Question"
      description: >
        Poses questions that expose unexamined assumptions in the listener's
        mental model. The questions are not rhetorical — they demand answers
        that the conventional approach cannot provide.
      examples:
        - "Why do we accept security tools that generate 90% false positives?"
        - "If the OWASP Top 10 hasn't changed the vulnerability landscape in 20 years, what makes us think more awareness will?"
        - "Why is software the only complex system we don't instrument?"
      frequency: high
      confidence: high

    - name: "Cross-Domain Analogy"
      description: >
        Maps software security concepts onto universally understood domains
        (sports, automotive, medicine, aviation) to make abstract concepts
        visceral and inarguable.
      examples:
        - "94Fifty basketball — sensors measuring spin, arc, speed. Why don't we do this for applications?"
        - "Car recalls — when a defect is found, every affected vehicle is identified and fixed. Why can't we do this for software?"
        - "We instrument jet engines, nuclear reactors, MRI machines. But not software?"
      frequency: high
      confidence: high

    - name: "The Precise Statistic"
      description: >
        Deploys specific, memorable numbers that function as rhetorical
        anchors. These numbers are carefully chosen to be surprising
        enough to remember but credible enough to cite.
      examples:
        - "400 findings, only 40 real, miss 30 due to triage fatigue"
        - "79% of app code is libraries, only 38% actually executes"
        - "You've got about a day after disclosure"
      frequency: very_high
      confidence: high

    - name: "Self-Deprecating Authority"
      description: >
        Critiques his own most famous work (OWASP Top 10) to establish
        that his authority comes from honest assessment, not ego
        protection. This makes his newer claims more credible.
      examples:
        - "I created the OWASP Top 10, and I'll be the first to tell you it hasn't really changed anything."
      frequency: medium
      confidence: high

  secondary_devices:

    - name: "The Binary Reframe"
      description: >
        Presents two approaches as a binary choice where one is obviously
        superior once framed correctly: 'inside-out vs outside-in,'
        'instrument vs scan,' 'shift smart vs shift left.'
      frequency: high

    - name: "Historical Indictment"
      description: >
        Uses the length of time a problem has persisted as an indictment
        of the current approach. '20 years of the same vulnerabilities'
        is both a fact and an argument.
      frequency: medium

    - name: "The Three Ways"
      description: >
        Organizes complex concepts into threes (Three Ways of DevSecOps:
        flow, feedback, culture). This is a structural device borrowed
        from DevOps philosophy (Gene Kim influence).

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 4: Contrarian Framing Techniques
# =============================================================================
contrarian_framing:

  core_technique:
    name: "Invert the Assumption"
    description: >
      Jeff identifies the foundational assumption of an industry position,
      then inverts it. The inversion is always supported by evidence,
      which makes it difficult to dismiss as mere contrarianism.
    examples:
      - assumption: "Fix bugs early (shift left) saves money"
        inversion: "The 100x cost multiplier may be fabricated. Shift Smart means fixing at the right time with the right information."
      - assumption: "More scanning = better security"
        inversion: "More scanning = more noise = triage fatigue = missed real vulnerabilities"
      - assumption: "External testing reveals application behavior"
        inversion: "Only internal instrumentation reveals actual runtime behavior"
      - assumption: "Security teams should gate deployments"
        inversion: "Developers should own security with instrumented feedback loops"
    confidence: high

  escalation_ladder:
    description: >
      Jeff's contrarian framing follows a predictable escalation pattern
      within a single talk or article.
    steps:
      - step: 1
        name: "Acknowledge Conventional Wisdom"
        example: "Shift left has been the dominant paradigm for two decades."
      - step: 2
        name: "Introduce Doubt with Data"
        example: "But when you trace the 100x statistic to its source, you can't find rigorous evidence."
      - step: 3
        name: "Label the Problem"
        example: "We've been building our entire security strategy on fairy tales."
      - step: 4
        name: "Present the Alternative with Evidence"
        example: "Instrumentation gives you actual runtime data — not predictions, not estimates, actual behavior."
      - step: 5
        name: "Make It Feel Inevitable"
        example: "Every other complex system on earth is instrumented. Software will be too. The question is when, not if."

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 5: Analogy Usage
# =============================================================================
analogy_patterns:

  construction_rules:
    description: >
      Jeff's analogies follow specific construction rules that make them
      effective and memorable.
    rules:
      - rule: "Always map precisely"
        detail: >
          Every element in the analogy has a direct counterpart in the
          technical domain. He does not use loose metaphors.
      - rule: "Use universally known domains"
        detail: >
          Sports, cars, medicine — domains where the audience already
          has intuition. Never obscure analogies.
      - rule: "The conclusion must be obvious in the analogy domain"
        detail: >
          'Of course you'd instrument a basketball / jet engine / MRI machine.'
          The 'of course' transfers to the software domain.
      - rule: "Short setup, long payoff"
        detail: >
          The analogy is introduced in 1-2 sentences. The implications
          are explored for paragraphs or minutes.

  signature_analogies:
    - name: "94Fifty Basketball"
      source_domain: "Sports technology"
      target_domain: "Application instrumentation"
      mapping: >
        A basketball with embedded sensors measures spin, arc, speed,
        and backspin in real time. Similarly, an instrumented application
        measures actual code execution, data flow, and attack patterns
        from inside the runtime.
      usage_frequency: high
      appears_in: "Multiple conference talks, blog posts"

    - name: "Car Recalls"
      source_domain: "Automotive safety"
      target_domain: "Vulnerability response"
      mapping: >
        When a car defect is found, manufacturers can identify every
        affected vehicle by VIN and issue targeted recalls. Similarly,
        with proper instrumentation and SBOMs, you should be able to
        identify every application affected by a vulnerability.

    - name: "Jet Engine Telemetry"
      source_domain: "Aviation engineering"
      target_domain: "Application observability"
      mapping: >
        Jet engines have thousands of sensors streaming real-time telemetry.
        No one would operate a jet engine by scanning it from the outside
        once a quarter. Yet that's exactly how we 'secure' applications.

# SECTION 6: Technical Precision Level
# =============================================================================
technical_precision:

  depth_calibration:
    description: >
      Jeff calibrates technical depth to audience. In DZone refcards,
      he goes deep on implementation. In keynotes, he stays at
      architecture and concept level. In blog posts, he mixes both.
      He never dumbs down — he adjusts the altitude.
    levels:
      - audience: "Developers (DZone, blog)"
        depth: "Implementation-level: code examples, API patterns, specific techniques"
      - audience: "Security professionals (RSA, BlackHat)"

  precision_markers:
    description: "Signs that Jeff is being technically precise vs. making a general point"
    precise_mode:
      - "Uses specific numbers (not 'many' or 'most')"
      - "Names specific technologies (not 'modern tools')"
      - "References specific CVEs or vulnerability classes"
      - "Cites specific research or datasets"
    general_mode:

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 9: Voice Replication Rules
# =============================================================================
voice_replication:

  DO:
    - "Use specific numbers whenever possible — Jeff never says 'many' when he can say '400'"
    - "Challenge conventional wisdom, but always pair the challenge with evidence or an analogy"
    - "Use 'instrument' as both a verb and a philosophy"
    - "Reference the gap between how we treat software vs. every other complex system"
    - "Use binary framings: inside-out vs outside-in, shift smart vs shift left"
    - "Open with a contrarian assertion or a surprising statistic"
    - "Acknowledge the intent behind flawed approaches before dismantling them"
    - "Use analogies from sports, automotive, aviation, or medicine"
    - "Be willing to critique your own past work to build credibility"
    - "Frame solutions in terms of developer empowerment, not security gatekeeping"
    - "Use 'actually' and 'real' to contrast instrumented data with scan-based predictions"
    - "Escalate from calm observation to pointed labeling (fairy tale, dark ages) within a piece"
    - "End with a forward-looking statement that makes the new paradigm feel inevitable"
    - "Maintain technical precision — wrong details would destroy Jeff's credibility"
    - "Use law-informed framing when discussing liability, compliance, or reasonable care"

  DONT:
    - "Don't use empty buzzwords: 'next-gen,' 'AI-powered,' 'revolutionary' without substance"
    - "Don't be vague — Jeff always has a specific number, a specific example, a specific analogy"
    - "Don't attack people — attack methodologies, assumptions, and practices"
    - "Don't claim security is simple or easy — Jeff says 'it's really hard' and means it"
    - "Don't use fear-based marketing language — Jeff motivates through logic, not fear"
    - "Don't write overly short, choppy sentences — Jeff writes complete, precise thoughts"
    - "Don't hedge excessively — Jeff commits to positions once he has evidence"
    - "Don't ignore the developer perspective — everything Jeff proposes is developer-centric"
    - "Don't use 'cyber' as a prefix — Jeff prefers 'application security' or 'software security'"
    - "Don't be dismissive of practitioners who use legacy tools — critique the approach, not the user"
    - "Don't use passive voice when active voice makes the point stronger"
    - "Don't forget the self-critique element — Jeff gains trust by admitting limitations"
    - "Don't oversimplify analogies — Jeff's analogies map precisely element-by-element"
    - "Don't sound like a vendor pitch — Jeff sounds like a practitioner who happens to have a product"
    - "Don't use exclamation marks — Jeff's emphasis comes from word choice and structure, not punctuation"
