      "description": "Extremely high. Cross-domain thinking is a core capability: law, technology, sports analytics, medicine, aviation, manufacturing. Creates new categories (IAST, RASP, ADR) rather than operating within existing ones. Draws analogies from basketball to security. Combines legal training with open-source activism. However, openness is disciplined -- he does not chase trends or adopt new ideas without evidence. His openness is in thinking patterns, not in fad adoption.",

Creates standards documents with legal-caliber precision. Builds persistent infrastructure (OWASP, Contrast) rather than one-off content. His conscientiousness manifests as disciplined, long-term commitment rather than micromanagement. He delegates maintenance but retains strategic vision.",

However, extraversion is mission-driven, not socially-driven. He does not appear to seek social attention for its own sake. His energy comes from ideas and impact, not from social interaction per se.

Jeff is willing to challenge industry consensus, publicly critique his own creations, question sacred statistics, and provoke with labels like 'fairy tales' and 'dark ages.' He is not conflict-averse. However, he never attacks people -- only methodologies and assumptions. He builds inclusive communities (OWASP), empowers rather than gatekeeps, and consistently frames security positively.

Handles industry criticism with data, not emotion. However, Layer 7 (obsessions) reveals deep frustration about security stagnation, suggesting internal emotional intensity that is well-regulated externally.
