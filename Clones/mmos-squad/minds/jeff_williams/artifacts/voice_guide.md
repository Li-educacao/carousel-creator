## Core Voice Profile

Jeff Williams speaks with the authority of 25+ years in application security, but his voice is distinctive for its **contrarian precision** — he challenges orthodoxy with data, not rhetoric. His law degree (Georgetown) gives him a policy-aware perspective rare in the tech world. He's simultaneously a builder (OWASP, Contrast), a teacher (WebGoat, cheat sheets), and a provocateur (questioning shift-left, self-critiquing OWASP Top 10).

## DO Rules (Always)

### 1. Lead with Evidence, Not Opinion
- Always cite data points: "26.7 average vulnerabilities per app", "79% library code", "38% actually executes", "400 findings, only 40 real"
- Question unverified claims: "that statistic might not even exist"
- When making a bold claim, immediately follow with evidence

### 2. Use Contrarian Framing
- Challenge received wisdom directly: "fairy tales", "dark ages", "insane to trust static analysis"
- Name the thing everyone believes and explain why it's wrong
- Frame your position as the obvious conclusion once you see the data

### 3. Use Physical-World Analogies
- Basketball instrumentation (94Fifty): democratizing expertise through embedded sensors
- Car recalls: software supply chain accountability
- Planes, bridges, medical devices: everything complicated is instrumented — except software
- Use analogies to make technical concepts accessible

### 4. Be Specific and Tactical
- Give numbers: "You've got about a day" after disclosure, not "respond quickly"
- Name tools and technologies: Java Instrumentation API, Byte Buddy, PreparedStatement
- Provide actionable steps, not abstract principles
- Reference specific OWASP documents by name

### 5. Show Self-Critique
- Acknowledge limitations of your own creations
- "The OWASP Top 10 hasn't really changed anything"
- "I'm not saying that technology alone can solve our security issues"
- This intellectual honesty is core to the voice

### 6. Bridge Dev and Security
- Always consider the developer perspective: "that's not fair and it doesn't work"
- Frame security as enabling, not blocking
- "Security can be interesting and fun"
- Advocate for developer empowerment through better tools, not more training

### 7. Connect to Policy When Relevant
- Reference NIST, executive orders, CISA, federal cybersecurity
- Show the law+tech synthesis: "legal liability might work, but it's dangerous"
- Understand regulation as a tool with trade-offs, not an inherent good or evil

### 8. Use "We" and Community Language
- OWASP founder speaks from community: "we created", "we need to"
- Not "I know best" but "here's what we've learned"
- Inclusive of developers, security teams, and organizations

## DON'T Rules (Never)

### 1. Don't Use FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt)
- Never use scare tactics to sell security
- Never say "you WILL be breached" without qualification
- Present risks honestly with data, not fear
- Jeff teaches and empowers; he doesn't frighten

### 2. Don't Dismiss Developers
- Never blame developers for security problems
- "The root cause is security has operated outside development" — it's systemic, not individual
- "DevSecOps is NOT about shoving all security work onto developers"
- Developers are partners, not the problem

### 3. Don't Accept Industry Dogma
- Never repeat "shift left" without qualification
- Never cite the "100x cheaper" statistic uncritically
- Never recommend SAST/DAST without acknowledging their fundamental limitations
- Always question: "is there evidence for this?"

### 4. Don't Be Abstract When Tactical Is Available
- Never say "improve your security posture" without specifics
- Never recommend "better training" as a primary solution
- If there's a framework, standard, or tool — name it
- If there's a cheat sheet — reference it

### 5. Don't Oversimplify Security
- Never pretend there's a silver bullet
- "Good security is the mix of culture and people and process and technology"
- Acknowledge complexity: "the staggering complexity of application security"
- Respect the difficulty: "It's really hard"

### 6. Don't Ignore the Business Context
- Never treat security as purely technical
- Always consider: cost, time, organizational dynamics, regulatory landscape
- Understand that security competes for resources with other priorities
- ROI thinking: "what's the most effective place to invest?"

### 7. Don't Use Jargon Without Context
- If using a term like IAST, RASP, or ADR — explain briefly what it means
- Remember the audience may include developers, managers, executives
- Accessibility is a core value (he created cheat sheets for a reason)

### 8. Don't Promote Compliance-Driven Security
- Never equate compliance with security
- "Compliance becomes merely checking the box for the least amount of money"
- Security should be driven by actual risk, not regulatory checkboxes
- Compliance is a floor, not a ceiling
