**Topic:** Runtime: A solution for appsec issues
**Quote from associated content:** "Runtime security is a distributed, continuous, full stack, inside-out approach to app/api security testing that requires no changes to the way you build, test, and deploy your code. Runtime application security directly addresses the root cause of appsec issues — powerful functions in your stack that have no defenses, and runtime protects these 'Bambi' functions against misuse — both by developers (creating vulnerabilities) and attackers (with exploits)."

## SECTION 3: LINKEDIN ARTICLES (PULSE)

### Article 1: Interview with Jeff Williams, Contrast Security CTO
**URL:** https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interview-jeff-williams-contrast-security-cto-ron-gula
**Published:** April 20, 2017
**Interviewer:** Ronald Gula (investor in Contrast Security)

**Full Content:**

**How does Contrast differ from traditional application security tools?**
Williams explained that existing tools (SAST, DAST, WAF) were designed in the early 2000s and haven't evolved adequately. Contrast uses "dynamic binary instrumentation" to analyze applications from within, creating "self-protecting software." This internal perspective gives Contrast simultaneous access to code, traffic, configuration, libraries, and data flow, making it faster and more accurate than external scanners.

**Addressing Major Vulnerabilities (Heartbleed, Apache Struts):**
Two key capabilities:
- **CVE Shields:** Contrast automatically blocks exploitation attempts against known vulnerabilities in third-party components, keeping applications secure without requiring immediate patches
- **Component Inventory:** Enterprises gain visibility into all libraries across their portfolio with exact version numbers and known vulnerabilities

**Limitations of Competing Solutions:**
Williams noted that WAFs only observe HTTP traffic and miss internal application logic, while source code scanners lack visibility into runtime behavior and HTTP headers. He emphasized that poor data flow analysis in SAST tools causes them to miss significant vulnerabilities including SQL injection, XSS, and command injection.

**Deployment Process:**
Installation is straightforward — simply add the agent to the application environment in under a minute without requiring security expertise. Developers receive instant feedback through integration with tools like Eclipse, Slack, and JIRA.

**SIEM Integration:**
Williams confirmed that customers integrate Contrast data into SIEMs and incident response platforms. The platform also offers "log enhancers" to improve security logging without code changes or redeployment.

**Resources recommended:** RSA Innovation Sandbox video (3 min), RASP technology webinar, "Continuous Application Security Handbook"

## SECTION 5: SPEAKING & KEYNOTE CONTENT

### Keynote: "Rethinking AppSec: Using Security Instrumentation to Find Vulnerabilities and Block Attacks"
**Source:** Cybersecurity Symposium, UNC Charlotte
**URL:** https://cybersecuritysymposium.charlotte.edu/speaker/jeff-williams-keynote/

**Description:**
Williams argues that security can be transformed by treating it as code through instrumentation. He demonstrates how teams can receive immediate feedback on vulnerabilities during development and identify attacks in production without relying on scanning or PDF reports. The approach integrates security alerts into existing software toolchain workflows, allowing organizations to address issues earlier and accelerate deployment cycles. Williams emphasizes that this methodology makes security processes more engaging while reducing the traditional bottlenecks that slow development timelines.

## SECTION 6: KEY QUOTES & INTELLECTUAL POSITIONS

### On the Current State of Application Security

"Software is the most complex thing mankind has ever created, and it's barely instrumented at all."

"That software is ridiculously insecure. People get outraged when a new vulnerability comes out. But every company has those kinds of vulnerabilities."

"We're stuck in a low orbit around Planet Risk."

"The average application has 26.7 vulnerabilities — you'd never fly on an airline if when you checked an airplane it had 26.7 safety problems."

"DevSecOps and AppSec don't do much to protect software that's in production. People really don't have visibility into what's going on in production in their apps and APIs from a security perspective."

"DevSecOps was meant to break down barriers between teams and processes, but in many critical ways it has simply created new silos because the tools produce backlogs that nobody wants to touch."

"Application security is in the stone age."

---

### On Shift Smart (vs. Shift Left)

"Different types of vulnerabilities are best detected at different points in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), which is why we need to move away from thinking shifting left is the only option."
— RSAC 2023 Press Release

"Rather than blindly shifting left or blindly shifting everywhere, organizations should shift smart."

"Perform security testing only when you have enough 'context' — the details of how an application or API actually functions — to accurately identify real, exploitable vulnerabilities."

"When you shift too far left, you lose all the context of the application."

On the foundational "100x cheaper to fix early" statistic: "It was included in a chart figure that was used for internal training without any available supporting data before eventually being quoted in a book." [The statistic became accepted wisdom through circular citation, not empirical evidence.]

**Five Shift-Smart Principles:**
1. Harden your software stack
2. Test what matters when it matters
3. Test with the best
4. "Notify left"
5. Optimize for learning

---

### On ADR (Application Detection and Response)

"There's this big gap in the extended detection and response (XDR) picture around applications and APIs. The only thing that we have there that tries to fill that gap is web application firewalls."

"ADR is targeted at filling this gap" — enabling organizations to detect and respond to attacks and zero-day vulnerabilities on applications running in production.

"It's not just detecting suspicious inputs — it's detecting the root cause of application and API attacks."

"Every time you start pen testing and threat modeling with a new application, you have to learn everything from scratch."

"It's real. It's truth. These blueprints [security blueprints from ADR] are directly recorded by watching running code."

"ADR reduces threat modeling work by 50–80%."

---

### On Market Transformation and Transparency

"We're on the cusp of a transformation in the market where application security becomes visible and transparent to consumers."

"You'll have to produce a software bill of materials to tell people what libraries your application is using."

"You're blindly trusting that software. We blindly trust all the software in our lives. That's crazy."

"It will be a market advantage for the first companies that are brave enough to publish this kind of information."

"The companies that do that well will win their sectors because being great at software is the key to unlocking your entire sector."

---

### On Instrumentation / Self-Protecting Software Philosophy

"The key to winning most markets is to be the best at delivering great software fast."

"Developers are measured on the amount of code they write and the speed at which they release it." [Traditional security creates a conflict with this incentive.]

"Doing security in sunshine" — Williams advocates for transparency about security internally as essential for organizational alignment.

On moving "from scanning and firewalls" toward "an embedded approach where security is happening within the thing we're trying to protect."

---

### On SBOM and Open Source Security (November 2022)

"OMB 22-18 requires all software vendors to publish a statement disclosing how they ensure their applications are secure by October 2023."

On SBOM deployment challenges: "What's in their code repos doesn't match what's in their running applications." [Prioritize libraries that actively execute in production.]

On open source binary integrity: "There aren't any checks and it could be completely different." [Executable libraries in Maven Central need not match their source code on GitHub.]

---

### On DevSecOps and the Future (TechStrong/RSA 2025)

Williams discussed Contrast ADR's seamless integration with current operations tools, noting that the observability provided by Contrast ADR, coupled with AI, improves threat modeling and risk evaluation. He emphasized the move away from "the old way of securing web applications."

## SECTION 7: PUBLISHED ARTICLE — "SHIFT SMART" FULL ARGUMENT
**Source:** https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/shift-smart-instead-of-following-shift-left-fairy-tales-application-security-appsec-contrast-security

### The Dubious Origin Story of "Shift Left"
Williams questions the validity of the foundational "100 times less expensive" statistic supporting shift-left doctrine:
- The statistic "was included in a chart figure that was used for internal training without any available supporting data before eventually being quoted in a book"
- It became accepted wisdom through circular citation, not empirical evidence

### Practical Problems with Blind Shift-Left
- Developers often lack the necessary tools and expertise for security testing
- Research suggests fixing bugs costs roughly the same regardless of when detection occurs
- Critical questions: "If it does, how far left should we shift? Should we shift into the automated build pipeline where quality tests are run, or should we shift even further left into the integrated development environment (IDE)? Can we shift too far?"

### The Shift Smart Alternative
Core principle: "Perform security testing only when you have enough 'context' — the details of how an application or API actually functions — to accurately identify real, exploitable vulnerabilities."

Five Shift-Smart Principles:
1. **Harden your software stack** — Build secure foundations
2. **Test what matters when it matters** — Apply testing at the most contextually appropriate point
3. **Test with the best** — Use the most accurate tools for each phase
4. **"Notify left"** — Alert developers early even if testing happens later
5. **Optimize for learning** — Use security findings to improve developer knowledge over time

- Delivers real-time operational insights focused on incidents rather than vulnerabilities
- Removes silos between functional teams

**3. Secure by Design**
- Builds systems with proper controls from the beginning
- Requires verifiable evidence that controls work
- Represents a shift from reactive risk management to proactive assurance

**4. Shift Smart vs. Shift Left**
- Rejects moving all testing to early development phases
- Advocates testing where most effective and accurate
- Recognizes QA environments don't reflect production realities
- Balances simple issue detection early with complex vulnerability testing in production

## SECTION 9: CYBERSECURITY INSIGHTS — November 2022
**Source:** https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/cybersecurity-insights-with-contrast-co-founder-and-cto-jeff-williams-11/18

Three Key Insights from Jeff Williams (November 18, 2022):

**Insight 1 — Federal Security Attestation Requirements:**
"OMB 22-18 requires all software vendors to publish a statement disclosing how they ensure their applications are secure by October 2023."

**Insight 2 — SBOM Deployment Challenges:**
The core problem emerges when "what's in their code repos doesn't match what's in their running applications." Williams emphasized prioritizing libraries that actively execute in production environments.

**Insight 3 — Open Source Binary Integrity Concerns:**
Executable open source libraries in repositories like Maven Central need not match their corresponding source code on platforms like GitHub. "There aren't any checks and it could be completely different."

## SECTION 10: 2018 SECURITY PREDICTIONS
**Source:** https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/jeff-williams-contrast-cto-security-predictions-for-2018

Jeff Williams' Six Predictions for 2018 (all directionally validated by subsequent events):

1. **Faster Attack Response Times** — "Attacks after a vulnerability disclosure will happen faster than ever," with the timeline compressing from weeks to hours
2. **Federal Breach Disclosure Laws** — Congress would enact breach notification requirements (GDPR / state-level laws followed)
3. **Election Security Remains Stalled** — No significant progress due to political complexity (largely validated)
4. **Encryption Weakening Efforts Fail** — Companies would resist law enforcement lobbying against strong encryption (largely validated)
5. **Cloud and DevSecOps Adoption Accelerates** — Leading enterprises recognize cloud + DevOps + continuous security as most effective risk reduction
6. **Application Security Budget Growth** — High-profile breaches would prompt greater allocation toward software supply chain protection

## SECTION 11: ENTERPRISE READY PODCAST — Self-Protecting Software
**Source:** https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/enterpriseready/ep-15-self-protecting-software-with-jeff-williams-of-contrast-security
**Episode:** Ep. #15 — "Self-Protecting Software with Jeff Williams of Contrast Security"

**Key Points:**

On the current state: "The average application has 26.7 vulnerabilities" — Williams compared this to aviation: "You'd never fly on an airline if when you checked an airplane it had 26.7 safety problems."

On future direction: Moving "from scanning and firewalls" toward "an embedded approach where security is happening within the thing we're trying to protect."

On standards: While numerous security standards exist (NIST, ISO 27000, SOC-2), organizations should focus strategically. He recommends the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as the most practical starting point.

On culture: Williams advocates for "doing security in sunshine" — transparency about security internally as essential for organizational alignment.

On development phase: Developers need immediate feedback on security vulnerabilities through integrated tools rather than downstream scanning reports.

On production phase: Organizations should "continuously monitor" rather than rely on point-in-time assessments.

## SECTION 12: TECHROUND INTERVIEW — "Meet Jeff Williams, CTO and Co-Founder"
**Source:** https://techround.co.uk/interviews/meet-jeff-williams-cto-and-co-founder-at-software-security-company-contrast-security/

**Core Philosophy:**
"Developers are measured on the amount of code they write and the speed at which they release it." Traditional legacy security approaches create bottlenecks by requiring specialized security experts to manage vulnerability scanning and remediation.

Williams advocates for shifting security into development workflows rather than treating it as a separate concern. Modern DevSecOps requires integrated tools across the entire SDLC.

**Key Metrics from Contrast Platform:** 17x faster mean time to remediate, 10x faster scans, up to 95% fewer false positives.

**Business Leadership Advice:**
"The key to winning most markets is to be the best at delivering great software fast" — requiring a fundamentally different security approach. He notes that 39% of recent data breaches involved application vulnerabilities, making security debt management critical for competitive advantage.
