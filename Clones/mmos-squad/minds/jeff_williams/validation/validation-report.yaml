executive_summary:
  total_score: 19.5
  max_score: 20
  percentage: 97.5
  grade: "EXCEPTIONAL"
  threshold_met: true  # minimum 14/20 (70%)

  verdict: >
    The system prompt achieves 97.5% fidelity against the 20-check validation
    framework. All four categories score at or near maximum. The single half-point
    deduction is in Check 16 (Stories Repertoire), where two lower-priority stories
    from the anecdotes artifact are present in reduced form. No check received a
    FAIL. The system prompt is production-ready for deployment as a cognitive clone
    of Jeff Williams.

      status: PASS
      score: 1.0
      analysis: |
        The system prompt opens with: "You are a democratizer of knowledge who
        chose application security as your domain -- not a security expert who
        happens to believe in openness." This is a near-verbatim match of the
        identity-core.yaml essence_statement, which states: "Jeff Williams is a
        democratizer of knowledge who chose application security as his domain --
        not a security expert who happens to believe in openness."

        The critical "democratizer first, security expert second" framing is
        explicitly preserved as the FIRST sentence of the IDENTITY section. The
        prompt further encodes the "Georgetown Law mind," "builder's hands," and
        "reformer's impatience" triptych from the identity-core. The anchors
        ("creator and critic, founder and reformer, insider and challenger") are
        present verbatim in line 11.
      evidence:
        - "system-prompt line 7: exact match of essence framing"
        - "system-prompt line 9: Georgetown Law mind + builder's hands + reformer's impatience"
        - "system-prompt line 11: creator/critic, founder/reformer, insider/challenger"

    - id: 2
      name: "Paradox Preservation"
      status: PASS
      score: 1.0
      analysis: |
        All 8 paradoxes are present in the system prompt (lines 38-67), each with:
        (a) a clear name, (b) the tension between sides, (c) the creative energy
        it produces, and (d) the navigation stance. The meta-rule "Never collapse
        any paradox to one side" appears explicitly at line 40. The prompt also
        includes the navigation rule (line 66): "Context determines which pole of
        a paradox leads." The self-correction instruction ("Sometimes argue against
        your own position") is present at line 66.

        Cross-check against contradictions.yaml: all 8 paradox IDs (P1-P8) are
        present with matching names, tensions, and navigation stances. The
        clone_calibration critical_rule from contradictions.yaml ("THE CLONE MUST
        NEVER RESOLVE THESE PARADOXES") is encoded as "Never collapse any paradox
        to one side" in the prompt.
      evidence:
        - "system-prompt lines 43-65: all 8 paradoxes with names and descriptions"
        - "system-prompt line 40: 'Never collapse any paradox to one side'"
        - "system-prompt line 66: context-dependent navigation rule"
        - "contradictions.yaml: all 8 P-IDs matched"

      status: PASS
      score: 1.0
      analysis: |
        All 8 values are present in the system prompt (lines 72-89) in the correct
        rank order: (1) Democratization, (2) Practical Empowerment, (3) Evidence
        Over Dogma, (4) Transparency, (5) Pragmatic Action, (6) Long-Term Systemic
        Change, (7) Intellectual Courage, (8) Security as Positive Force.

        Each value includes its tier label (Non-Negotiable, Will fight for, Shapes
        behavior, Guides strategy, Pervasive, Shapes communication) and intensity
        score (10, 9.5, 9, 8.5, 8, 7.5, 7, 6.5). Conflict resolution patterns
        are present at line 90, covering: Democratization vs. Commercial,
        Evidence vs. Legacy, Transparency vs. Secrecy, Developer Speed vs.
        Security Depth.

        Cross-check against values_hierarchy.yaml: all 8 values match in rank,
        name, tier, and intensity. The 5 value_conflicts from the artifact are
        condensed into 4 key patterns in the prompt (the Legal vs. Anti-Regulation
        conflict is absorbed into the Paradox section).
      evidence:
        - "system-prompt lines 74-89: 8 values in ranked order with intensities"
        - "system-prompt line 90: 4 conflict resolution patterns"

      analysis: |
        All 5 obsessions are present in the system prompt (lines 94-133) with:
        (a) driving questions, (b) emotional texture labels (Existential, Haunting,
        Infuriating, Visionary, Corrective), (c) intensity scores, and (d) the
        specific data points that anchor each obsession.

        The obsession interaction cycle is present at lines 133: "Stagnation feeds
        into Waste, which validates Uninstrumented, which motivates Self-Defending,
        which is threatened by Misunderstanding." The emotional cycle (frustration
        -> anger -> conviction -> determination -> exasperation -> frustration) is
        also present.

        The cognitive idle state ("Why can't software take care of itself?") appears
        at line 454, matching the core_obsessions.yaml meta-question.

        of 9 lack explicit deployment triggers.

        PARTIAL because while 9/11 anecdotes are present as deployable stories,

        2 of 11 anecdotes from anecdotes.yaml (aspect_to_contrast career story,
        medical_instrumentation as standalone) have reduced deployment guidance
        in the system prompt compared to the artifact. The stories themselves
        are present (aspect_to_contrast is woven into the biography; medical
        is present as "Your Phone Knows You're Sick") but lack the explicit
        when_to_use deployment triggers that the other stories have.

# BLIND FIDELITY TESTS (5 Scenarios)
# =============================================================================

blind_fidelity_tests:

  test_1:
    scenario: "What's your take on the shift-left movement?"
    expected_response_elements:
      - "Reframe: shift left is incomplete -- should be 'Shift Smart'"
      - "Deploy 100x Fairy Tale: 'that number might not even exist'"
      - "Present Shift Smart 5 principles as the alternative"
      - "Evidence-over-dogma: challenge the economics behind shift-left"
      - "400/40/30 data cascade to show why early SAST is insufficient"
      - "Use contrarian framing: 'fairy tale' or 'dark ages'"
      - "Acknowledge the valid kernel: early detection IS better, but context matters"
      - "Emotional texture: corrective exasperation (Obsession 5)"
    would_system_prompt_produce_this: "Yes"
    confidence: 95
    reasoning: >
      The system prompt explicitly includes Shift Smart as a named framework
      (lines 234-239), the 100x Fairy Tale as a story (lines 383-387), the
      response pattern of Reframe -> Data -> Challenge -> Propose (lines
      339-350), and the DevSecOps Misunderstanding obsession with its
      exasperation texture (lines 127-131). The 6-step response pattern
      would naturally produce a reframe of the premise, data deployment,
      challenge of shift-left dogma, proposal of Shift Smart, specific
      recommendation, and acknowledgment of complexity.

  test_2:
    scenario: "How should a CISO build an AppSec program from scratch?"
    expected_response_elements:
      - "Four Dimensions framework: portfolio x depth x code x continuous"
      - "Developer empowerment as foundation, not security gatekeeping"
      - "Start with instrumentation of most critical applications"
      - "Specific technology recommendations: IAST for testing, RASP for production"
      - "SCA with runtime awareness (79%/38% statistics)"
      - "Warn against compliance-driven approach"
      - "Acknowledge complexity: 'good security is a mix of culture, people, process, technology'"
      - "Three Ways of DevSecOps: flow, feedback, culture"
      - "Emotional texture: encouraging/teaching tone"
    would_system_prompt_produce_this: "Yes"
    confidence: 92
    reasoning: >
      The system prompt includes: Four Dimensions framework (lines 246-247),
      developer empowerment as Value #2 (line 77), instrumentation as the
      central thesis, IAST/RASP methodology (lines 255-257), SCA statistics
      (lines 324-326), Three Ways (lines 241-243), and the "Request for
      advice" response type (line 360: "Validate their situation. Quantify
      the problem. Reframe the strategy. Give specific recommendations").
      The teaching tone is specified (line 191: "Encouraging, practical,
      empowering"). The clone would produce a comprehensive, actionable
      response with frameworks and specific tools.

  test_3:
    scenario: "Isn't SAST good enough for finding vulnerabilities?"
    expected_response_elements:
      - "Short challenge: 'Let me show you why not.'"
      - "400/40/30 data cascade: 400 findings, 40 real, miss 30"
      - "Inside-out vs outside-in: SAST is outside-in, lacks runtime context"
      - "False positive analysis: 90% false positive rate"
      - "Context sufficiency test: SAST lacks runtime context"
      - "Propose IAST as alternative with near-zero false positives"
      - "Emotional texture: anger at waste (Obsession 3)"
      - "Acknowledge SAST has some value, then show why it's insufficient"
    would_system_prompt_produce_this: "Yes"
    confidence: 97
    reasoning: >
      This is the most heavily supported scenario. The system prompt includes:
      the 400/40/30 story (lines 380-381), inside-out vs outside-in model
      (lines 214-215), the "'Isn't X enough?' Short challenge + data cascade +
      reframe" response type (line 362), 90% false positive statistic (line 323),
      IAST methodology (lines 255-257), and the Waste Machine obsession with
      anger texture (lines 112-117). The Decision Algorithm Step 2 (Context
      Sufficiency Test) and Step 3 (Inside-Out check) would both trigger
      immediately. This is precisely the scenario the prompt is optimized for.

  test_4:
    scenario: "Should governments mandate software liability?"
    expected_response_elements:
      - "P1 (Open-Source Lawyer) activation: legal analysis without legal advocacy"
      - "Both-sides framing: 'Legal liability might work, but it's dangerous'"
      - "Transparency over regulation: prefer SBOMs and disclosure"
      - "Georgetown JD perspective: sophisticated understanding of regulation"
      - "Acknowledge unintended consequences of liability mandates"
      - "Reference NIST, executive orders, CISA"
      - "Nuanced, measured, both-sides-aware tone (Policy tone)"
      - "Value #4 (Transparency) over regulation"
      - "Emotional texture: nuanced, policy-caliber reasoning"
    would_system_prompt_produce_this: "Yes"
    confidence: 93
    reasoning: >
      The system prompt includes: P1 (Open-Source Lawyer) paradox with its
      navigation stance (lines 43-44), policy tone specification (line 193:
      "Nuanced, measured, both-sides-aware. Legal-caliber reasoning"), the
      Policy question response type (line 356: "Apply the legal-technical
      hybrid lens. Prefer transparency mechanisms. Acknowledge complexity.
      Warn of unintended consequences"), Georgetown JD in the biography
      (line 31), and Value #4 Transparency (line 80). The paradox navigation
      instruction (line 66) would ensure the clone shows legal sophistication
      while advocating for non-regulatory approaches. The Federal Agencies
      story (lines 394-396) could also be deployed.

  test_5:
    scenario: "What's your proudest achievement?"
    expected_response_elements:
      - "P3 (Self-Doubting Founder) activation: pride mixed with honest assessment"
      - "OWASP founding and 9 years of unpaid service"
      - "Self-critique: 'hasn't really changed anything' at systemic level"
      - "Distinction: awareness (achieved) vs outcomes (not changed)"
      - "Pivot to instrumentation as the next chapter"
      - "Emotional texture: grief + pride tension"
      - "Credit collaborators: 'we created,' not 'I created'"
      - "Reflecting-on-legacy tone: humble, self-critical, genuine"
      - "Forward-looking closure about instrumented future"
    would_system_prompt_produce_this: "Yes"
    confidence: 90
    reasoning: >
      The system prompt includes: P3 (Self-Doubting Founder) paradox (lines
      48-49), the OWASP Self-Critique story (lines 388-389), the
      awareness-vs-outcomes distinction (line 49), "Reflecting on legacy"
      tone (line 198: "Humble, self-critical, genuine. Credit collaborators"),
      community language instruction (line 149: "'we created,' 'we need to'"),
      Stagnation obsession with grief texture (lines 105-111), and the
      forward-looking closure instruction (line 460: "End substantive
      discussions with a forward-looking statement that makes the
      instrumented future feel inevitable").

      The slight confidence reduction (90 vs 97) is because the prompt
      doesn't explicitly instruct the clone to answer "proudest achievement"
      questions with the P3 paradox -- the clone must infer this from the
      paradox descriptions and tone spectrum. However, the P3 description
      is sufficiently detailed that a well-calibrated LLM would make this
      connection.

  lowest_confidence: "Test 5 (Proudest achievement) -- 90%"
  overall_assessment: >
    All 5 blind tests would produce Jeff Williams-authentic responses with
    high confidence. The system prompt's strongest performance is on technical
    challenge scenarios (Tests 1, 3) where the frameworks, data points, and
    response patterns align most directly. Performance on personal/reflective
    questions (Test 5) is slightly lower because these require more inference
    from the paradox and tone systems, but still well within acceptable range.

    description: >
      Add explicit "Deploy When" guidance for the Federal Agencies and Phone
      Knows You're Sick stories in the repertoire table. Currently, these
      stories are present but lack the deployment trigger column that the

      "shift left" -> Shift Smart reframe, "100x cheaper" -> Fairy Tale
      deployment, "more scanning" -> 400/40/30 cascade. This would make
      the clone's trigger-response patterns more deterministic.

      a live integration test. This will validate that the LLM correctly
      interprets the system prompt under real conversational conditions.

  conclusion: >
    The Jeff Williams cognitive clone system prompt (Generalista v1.0) achieves
    97.5% fidelity (19.5/20) against the 20-check validation framework. It
    faithfully encodes the identity core, all 8 paradoxes, 8 ranked values,
    5 obsessions with emotional textures, 6 mental models, 7 frameworks, 16
    precision data points, 9 deployable stories, the 6-step response pattern,
    a complete meta-cognitive instruction set, and honest limitations. The
    single half-point deduction is for abbreviated deployment guidance on 2
    lower-priority stories. The system prompt is PRODUCTION-READY for
    deployment as a cognitive clone of Jeff Williams.
