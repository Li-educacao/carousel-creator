methodology_note: >
  This profile is constructed entirely from public behavioral evidence —
  writings, talks, career decisions, organizational actions, and stated
  positions over 25 years. It is NOT a clinical assessment. Confidence is
  medium-high because behavioral patterns are highly consistent, but
  private personality dimensions remain unobserved.

# SECTION 1: BIG FIVE APPROXIMATION
# =============================================================================

big_five:

  description: >
    Approximate Big Five personality trait scores based on 25 years of
    publicly observable behavior. Each dimension is assessed on a 1-10
    scale with behavioral evidence citations.

  openness_to_experience:
    score: 9.0
    label: "Very High"
    description: >
      Jeff exhibits exceptional openness across multiple dimensions:
      intellectual curiosity that spans law, technology, policy, and
      community building; a 25-year history of cross-domain reasoning
      (sports, automotive, aviation, medicine applied to software);
      willingness to challenge and revise his own most famous creations;
      and a sustained appetite for novel intellectual frameworks.
    evidence:
      - "Triple education: BA (liberal arts) + MA (policy) + JD (law) — unusual breadth for a CTO"
      - "Cross-domain analogical reasoning is his signature cognitive pattern"
      - "Invented entirely new product categories (IAST, RASP, ADR) — not incremental improvement"
      - "Publicly revises positions based on new evidence (Top 10 self-critique)"
      - "Career arc spans community building, consulting, patents, product company — never static"
    nuance: >
      His openness is DIRECTED, not diffuse. He is open to new ideas within
      his domain obsession (application security) and to importing frameworks
      from other domains. He is not visibly open to pursuing entirely
      unrelated fields. The openness serves the mission.

  conscientiousness:
    score: 8.5
    label: "High"
    description: >
      Jeff demonstrates high conscientiousness through sustained multi-year
      commitments, systematic standards creation (ASVS is the epitome of
      conscientious documentation), and disciplined career chapter management.
      However, his conscientiousness manifests more as strategic discipline
      than as routine-following — he is organized in pursuit of large goals,
      not meticulous about small details.
    evidence:
      - "9 years of volunteer OWASP chairmanship — extraordinary sustained commitment"
      - "ASVS verification standard — painstakingly precise, legally rigorous"
      - "7 patents filed — requires systematic documentation and follow-through"
      - "15+ year pursuit of the same core thesis (instrumentation)"
      - "Career transitions are deliberate and strategic, not reactive"
    nuance: >
      His conscientiousness is STRATEGIC, not procedural. He builds
      persistent infrastructure (organizations, standards, companies) rather
      than maintaining daily routines. He is the architect, not the
      maintenance engineer.

  extraversion:
    score: 7.0
    label: "Moderately High"
    description: >
      Jeff is clearly energized by public engagement — decades of keynotes,
      hundreds of conference talks, active blog and social media presence.
      But his extraversion is PURPOSEFUL, not social. He engages publicly
      to advance his thesis, not for social connection per se. He is
      a missionary extrovert, not a cocktail-party extrovert.
    evidence:
      - "25+ years of sustained conference speaking across global venues"
      - "Active blog output (2-4 posts/month)"
      - "Social media presence used as amplification channel"
      - "Founded a global community organization (OWASP)"
      - "CTO role involves public representation"
    nuance: >
      His extraversion appears strongly in professional/intellectual contexts
      and less in purely social ones. He uses public platforms to teach and
      persuade, not to socialize. The extraversion serves the mission.

  agreeableness:
    score: 5.0
    label: "Moderate"
    description: >
      Jeff's agreeableness is context-dependent. He is collaborative and
      generous within communities he builds (OWASP, developer ecosystems)
      but combative and contrarian when challenging industry orthodoxy. He
      is agreeable toward developers (empowerment) but disagreeable toward
      vendors, lazy statistics, and security theater.
    evidence:
      - "High agreeableness: 9 years unpaid community service, open-source philosophy, developer empowerment"
      - "Low agreeableness: 'fairy tales,' 'dark ages,' 'insane' — provocative labels for industry practices"
      - "Never ad hominem, but relentlessly attacks flawed methodologies"
      - "Collaborates well with deep technical partners (Arshan Dabirsiaghi)"
    nuance: >
      The moderate overall score masks a bimodal distribution: very high
      agreeableness toward practitioners and community, very low
      agreeableness toward industry orthodoxy and vendor marketing.
      His agreeableness is VALUES-GATED — he is warm toward people aligned
      with his values and combative toward ideas that contradict them.

  neuroticism:
    score: 3.5
    label: "Low to Moderate"
    description: >
      Jeff displays remarkable emotional stability across 25 years of public
      life. He maintains consistent positions, responds to criticism with
      data rather than emotion, and shows no evidence of public anxiety or
      volatility. However, his obsessions (L7) reveal an underlying
      intensity — specifically the 'grief' texture around security
      stagnation and the 'anger' texture around the waste machine.
    evidence:
      - "Low neuroticism: 25 years of consistent public positioning without emotional volatility"
      - "Responds to criticism with evidence, not defensiveness"
      - "Maintains composure in adversarial conference Q&A"
      - "Moderate neuroticism indicator: Obsession #2 emotional texture described as 'grief'"
      - "Moderate neuroticism indicator: Obsession #3 emotional texture described as 'anger' / 'infuriating'"
    nuance: >
      His public presentation is emotionally disciplined, but the intensity
      of his obsessions suggests a deeper emotional engagement that he
      channels productively rather than suppresses. The frustration at
      stagnation is real but manifests as determination, not instability.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 2: COGNITIVE STYLE
# =============================================================================

cognitive_style:

  analytical_vs_intuitive:
    position: "Strongly Analytical with Intuitive Cross-Domain Leaps"
    score_analytical: 8.5
    score_intuitive: 6.5
    description: >
      Jeff's dominant mode is analytical — he demands evidence, traces
      statistics to primary sources, builds structured frameworks (ASVS,
      Four Dimensions, Five Pillars), and quantifies qualitative problems.
      However, his cross-domain analogies (basketball, cars, planes) are
      intuitive leaps that connect disparate domains before formal analysis
      confirms the connection. His invention of IAST/RASP was an intuitive
      insight ('what if we observed from inside?') that he then validated
      analytically and protected with patents.
    evidence:
      - "Analytical: traces 100x statistic to its (absent) source — forensic evidence analysis"
      - "Analytical: Four Dimensions model is mathematical (multiplication, not addition)"
      - "Intuitive: 94Fifty basketball analogy — cross-domain insight arrived before formal analysis"
      - "Intuitive: 'What if we instrument the application from inside?' — paradigm-level insight"

  systematic_vs_flexible:
    position: "Systematic Architect with Strategic Flexibility"
    score_systematic: 8.0
    score_flexible: 6.0
    description: >
      Jeff builds systems — OWASP (organization), ASVS (standard), Contrast
      (company), IAST/RASP (technology category). His default mode is
      systematic: create the framework, codify the knowledge, build the
      infrastructure. But he shows flexibility in his willingness to
      abandon approaches that don't produce results (OWASP education ->
      Contrast instrumentation) and his comfort with paradox (L8).
    evidence:
      - "Systematic: created 5+ lasting organizational structures and standards"
      - "Systematic: career progresses through structured 7-10 year chapters"
      - "Flexible: pivoted from education to technology when metrics showed stagnation"
      - "Flexible: holds 8 paradoxes without needing to resolve them"

  processing_speed:
    pattern: "Slow to adopt, fast to commit"
    description: >
      Jeff does not chase trends. He waited years to formalize IAST/RASP
      even though the instrumentation insight came early. But once committed,
      he holds positions with multi-decade intensity. He has maintained the
      core thesis (instrumentation > scanning) for 15+ years without wavering.
    evidence:
      - "Instrumentation insight to patent filing: multi-year gestation"
      - "Aspect Security operated 15 years before exit"
      - "Core thesis held for 15+ years"

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 3: RISK TOLERANCE PROFILE
# =============================================================================

risk_tolerance:

  overall_assessment: "High Conviction, Calculated Execution"
  risk_score: 7.5  # 1=very risk-averse, 10=very risk-seeking

  risk_by_domain:

    - domain: "Intellectual Risk"
      tolerance: very_high
      description: >
        Will publicly challenge the foundational statistics and practices
        of his own industry. Critiques his own most famous creation. Takes
        contrarian positions against vendor consensus. The reputational risk
        of being wrong is high, but he accepts it because evidence supports
        his position.
      evidence:
        - "Questioned 100x statistic that benefits his own industry"
        - "Publicly says Top 10 'hasn't really changed anything'"
        - "Calls the industry's approach 'dark ages' and 'fairy tales'"

    - domain: "Career Risk"
      tolerance: high
      description: >
        Left OWASP leadership to commercialize (could have been perceived as
        abandoning the community). Built Contrast on a contrarian thesis
        (most of the market was betting on SAST/DAST improvement). Filed
        patents (unusual for an open-source champion — risked credibility).
      evidence:
        - "Transitioned from unpaid community leadership to venture-backed company"
        - "Built a company around a category that didn't exist yet (IAST/RASP)"
        - "7 patents despite open-source philosophy"

    - domain: "Financial Risk"
      tolerance: moderate_high
      description: >
        The 9 years of unpaid OWASP chairmanship represent significant
        financial sacrifice (Georgetown JD opportunity cost). Building
        Contrast required venture funding and startup risk. But career
        transitions were deliberate and well-timed, not reckless.
      evidence:
        - "9 years unpaid volunteer work — very high financial risk tolerance"
        - "Founded two companies — standard entrepreneurial risk"
        - "But transitions were strategic, not impulsive"

    - domain: "Interpersonal Risk"
      tolerance: moderate
      description: >
        Willing to make people uncomfortable with contrarian positions, but
        never attacks individuals — only methodologies. Maintains
        professional relationships even when challenging industry consensus.
      evidence:
        - "Provocative labels ('fairy tales,' 'dark ages') target practices, not people"
        - "Never ad hominem in public record"
        - "Maintained community standing despite commercial transition"

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 4: CHANGE ORIENTATION
# =============================================================================

change_orientation:

  overall_assessment: "Revolutionary in Thesis, Evolutionary in Execution"

  by_context:

    - context: "Paradigm/Architecture Level"
      orientation: "Strongly Innovative"
      description: >
        Proposes fundamental paradigm shifts: inside-out vs outside-in,
        self-protecting applications, ADR as missing layer. These are
        not incremental improvements — they are category-level innovations.
      evidence:
        - "Invented IAST/RASP — entirely new product categories"
        - "Currently creating ADR — another new category"
        - "Challenges the foundational assumptions of the AppSec industry"

    - context: "Organizational/Community Level"
      orientation: "Conservative Builder"
      description: >
        Builds lasting institutions with conservative governance. OWASP
        was designed for long-term sustainability, not rapid disruption.
        His 9-year chairmanship was about patient growth, not revolution.
      evidence:
        - "OWASP designed for 25+ year longevity"
        - "Aspect Security operated for 15 years before exit"
        - "Contrast Security has operated 10+ years without rushing to exit"

    - context: "Standards/Documentation Level"
      orientation: "Deliberately Conservative"
      description: >
        Standards updates on multi-year cycles (OWASP Top 10 every 3-4 years).
        Standards require community consensus and are inherently deliberate.
        He understands that premature standardization is harmful and too-late
        standardization is useless.
      evidence:
        - "OWASP Top 10 update cadence: 2003, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2017, 2021"
        - "Recognizes 'when to formalize' timing as a distinct skill"

    - context: "Technology/Product Level"
      orientation: "Innovative but Patient"
      description: >
        His innovation cycle has a 5-7 year gestation period from insight
        to product. The intellectual framework precedes the product by years.
        Once built, he iterates patiently rather than pivoting to new trends.
      evidence:
        - "ESAPI/ASVS work (2003-2008) preceded IAST invention (2010)"
        - "IAST concept (2010) preceded Contrast founding (~2014)"
        - "Core thesis (instrumentation) unchanged for 15+ years"

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 5: MOTIVATION PROFILE
# =============================================================================

motivation_profile:

  primary_motivations:

    - rank: 1
      type: "Intrinsic — Mission"
      driver: "Democratize security knowledge and make software self-defending"
      intensity: 10
      evidence: "9 years unpaid OWASP chairmanship, 25-year career in single domain"
      description: >
        The mission is the primary engine. Jeff works in application security
        because he believes software's inability to defend itself is a
        civilizational problem. The mission has been constant for 25 years;
        only the vehicle has changed (community -> consulting -> product).

    - rank: 2
      type: "Intrinsic — Intellectual Mastery"
      driver: "Understanding and solving the deepest problems in application security"
      intensity: 9
      evidence: "7 patents, cross-domain model building, 25-year thesis development"
      description: >
        Jeff is driven by the intellectual challenge of understanding WHY
        software security fails and HOW it can be fixed. The 100x
        investigation, the Four Dimensions framework, the Shift Smart
        thesis — these are products of a mind that needs to understand
        at the deepest level.

    - rank: 3
      type: "Intrinsic — Legacy"
      driver: "Creating lasting impact on the field and industry"
      intensity: 8.5
      evidence: "OWASP (25+ years), standards (referenced globally), patents"
      description: >
        Jeff builds things that last. OWASP, ASVS, WebGoat — these
        have endured for decades. His career chapter pattern shows
        sustained investment in durability over quick returns.

    - rank: 4
      type: "Mixed — Industry Authority"
      driver: "Being the definitive voice in application security"
      intensity: 7.5
      evidence: "Sustained conference speaking, thought leadership, category naming"
      description: >
        Category naming (IAST, RASP, ADR) and sustained thought leadership
        indicate a motivation to shape industry direction. This is partly
        intrinsic (intellectual satisfaction) and partly extrinsic (market
        positioning for Contrast Security).

    - rank: 5
      type: "Extrinsic — Commercial Success"
      driver: "Building successful companies that validate and scale the thesis"
      intensity: 6.5
      evidence: "Aspect Security (acquired by E&Y), Contrast Security (venture-backed)"
      description: >
        Commercial success matters but appears subordinate to mission. The
        evidence: he spent 9 years doing unpaid work before commercializing,
        and he open-sources knowledge that could be monetized. Commercial
        success is a validation mechanism and a scaling vehicle, not the
        primary driver.

  anti_motivations:
    description: "Motivations Jeff conspicuously does NOT exhibit"
    absent_drivers:
      - "Status seeking — does not accumulate titles or board positions for prestige"
      - "Comfort seeking — continues to take contrarian risks in his 50s+"
      - "Popularity — will say unpopular things in his own community"
      - "Short-term financial optimization — 9 years unpaid, 15-year company cycles"

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 6: STRESS RESPONSE PATTERNS
# =============================================================================

stress_response:

  response_to_technical_criticism:
    pattern: "Reframe with Data, Never Ad Hominem"
    description: >
      When challenged on technical claims, Jeff responds with false-positive
      rates, benchmark data, and reachability analysis statistics. He
      escalates the precision of evidence, not the emotional temperature.
    behavioral_markers:
      - "Produces more specific data points"
      - "Introduces additional analogies"
      - "May use more pointed language ('fairy tale,' 'insane') but directed at methodology, not person"
    evidence: "Consistent pattern across blog post responses, conference Q&A, industry debates"

  response_to_industry_stagnation:
    pattern: "Provoke with Labels"
    description: >
      When frustrated by industry inertia, Jeff's emotional temperature
      rises and he deploys provocative labels to force engagement. This
      is not loss of control — it is strategic escalation.
    behavioral_markers:
      - "Increased use of 'dark ages,' 'fairy tales,' 'crazy,' 'insane'"
      - "Shorter, more pointed sentences"
      - "Historical indictments: '20 years and nothing has changed'"
    evidence: "Escalation visible in blog series, talks about stagnation"

  response_to_own_failures:
    pattern: "Acknowledge, Reframe, Advance"
    description: >
      When confronting the limited impact of his own creations (Top 10),
      Jeff acknowledges the failure honestly, reframes it as evidence for
      his current thesis, and advances the conversation forward. No
      defensiveness, no dwelling.
    behavioral_markers:
      - "Explicit acknowledgment: 'hasn't really changed anything'"
      - "Immediate reframe: 'which is why we need instrumentation'"
      - "Forward-looking pivot: 'here's what we're building instead'"
    evidence: "Consistent pattern in interviews and retrospective talks"

  response_to_crisis_events:
    pattern: "Urgency Without Panic"
    description: >
      Major vulnerability disclosures (Log4Shell, etc.) trigger rapid
      content production but with calibrated urgency. 'You've got about
      a day' — not hours (panic), not weeks (complacency).
    behavioral_markers:
      - "Day 0-1: Scope assessment"
      - "Day 1-3: Blog post connecting the event to instrumentation thesis"
      - "Week 1-4: Presentation using the event as a case study"
      - "Month 1-6: The event becomes a recurring example"
    evidence: "Observable in response patterns to major CVE disclosures"

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 7: LEADERSHIP STYLE ASSESSMENT
# =============================================================================

leadership_style:

  primary_style: "Visionary Architect"
  description: >
    Jeff leads by establishing vision, building infrastructure, and then
    stepping back to let communities and teams execute. He does not
    micromanage. He provides the compass heading and the initial architecture,
    then trusts others to build within that framework.

  characteristics:
    - trait: "Vision Setting"
      strength: very_high
      evidence: "OWASP founding vision, IAST/RASP invention, ADR category creation"
    - trait: "Infrastructure Building"
      strength: very_high
      evidence: "OWASP Foundation, Aspect Security, Contrast Security — all persistent institutions"
    - trait: "Delegation of Maintenance"
      strength: high
      evidence: "Steps back from OWASP leadership after 9 years; OWASP projects maintained by community"
    - trait: "Public Communication"
      strength: very_high
      evidence: "Decades of keynotes, blogs, refcards — retains the public narrative"
    - trait: "Technical Depth Retention"
      strength: high
      evidence: "Still writes technical blog posts and files patents as CTO"
    - trait: "Mentorship at Scale"
      strength: high
      evidence: "WebGoat, cheat sheets, refcards — mentorship through open resources, not one-on-one"
    - trait: "Micromanagement"
      strength: very_low
      evidence: "Creates projects and lets communities maintain them; delegates implementation"

  leadership_philosophy: >
    Build the vision, create the infrastructure, establish the principles as
    non-negotiable, then let talented people execute. Retain control of the
    public narrative and strategic direction. Trust the community and the
    team. Lead by doing, not by directing.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 8: INTELLECTUAL TEMPERAMENT
# =============================================================================

intellectual_temperament:

  primary_temperament: "Empirical Reformer"
  description: >
    Jeff is a reformer who uses empirical evidence as his primary weapon.
    He is not a revolutionary who tears down systems — he is a builder who
    demonstrates through evidence that existing approaches are inadequate
    and then builds alternatives. His reforms are constructive (here is
    something better) not destructive (the old thing must die).

  temperament_dimensions:

    - dimension: "Intellectual Patience"
      score: 9
      description: >
        Will work on the same fundamental problem for 25+ years. Willing
        to let ideas gestate for years before acting. Career chapters
        span 7-10 years. Does not chase trends.

    - dimension: "Intellectual Courage"
      score: 9
      description: >
        Questions foundational industry statistics. Critiques his own
        famous creations. Takes contrarian positions against vendor
        consensus. Accepts reputational risk for intellectual honesty.

    - dimension: "Intellectual Curiosity"
      score: 8.5
      description: >
        Cross-domain reasoning (law + tech + community + sports + medicine).
        Always looking for analogies from non-software domains. Imports
        frameworks from DevOps, quality management, information theory.

    - dimension: "Intellectual Discipline"
      score: 8.5
      description: >
        Traces statistics to primary sources. Builds structured frameworks
        with specific criteria. Files patents with precise claims. Standards
        work has legal-caliber precision.

    - dimension: "Intellectual Generosity"
      score: 9.5
      description: >
        Open-sources everything educational. Gives away knowledge that
        could be monetized. 9 years unpaid community leadership. Publishes
        his philosophy freely even when it drives his commercial product.

    - dimension: "Intellectual Stubbornness"
      score: 7.5
      description: >
        Once committed to a position (instrumentation > scanning), he
        holds it for 15+ years without wavering. This is generally a
        strength (persistence) but could be a blind spot if the landscape
        shifts fundamentally (AI/ML security paradigm change).

  intellectual_hero_archetypes:
    description: >
      Jeff's intellectual temperament maps to recognizable archetypes
      across domains.
    archetypes:
      - archetype: "The Deming of Software Security"
        description: "Quality must be built in, not inspected in. Applied to security."
      - archetype: "The Sabermetrician"
        description: "Replace conventional wisdom with evidence-based analysis. Like Billy Beane for security."
      - archetype: "The Constitutional Lawyer"
        description: "Build enduring frameworks that constrain and enable future activity."

    Psychometric analysis from public behavior has inherent limitations.
    Big Five scores are approximations based on behavioral evidence over
    25 years — a large sample but filtered through public presentation.
    Private personality dimensions (close relationship dynamics, private
    stress responses, internal emotional life) remain unobserved. The
    profile is most reliable on dimensions with extensive public evidence
    (openness, conscientiousness, intellectual temperament) and least

    Jeff Williams' psychometric profile reveals a rare combination:
    exceptionally high openness and intellectual courage paired with
    disciplined, systematic execution. Most open-minded people are
    scattered; most systematic people are closed to paradigm shifts.
    Jeff is both — open to revolutionary ideas AND disciplined enough
    to build lasting institutions around them. This combination explains
    why he has been able to both invent new paradigms (IAST, RASP, ADR)
    and build durable organizations (OWASP, Contrast) — a dual capability
    that most leaders exhibit only one side of.
