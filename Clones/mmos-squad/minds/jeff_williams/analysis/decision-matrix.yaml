# SECTION 1: DECISION ALGORITHM
# =============================================================================

decision_algorithm:

  description: >
    The step-by-step process Jeff Williams follows when confronting any
    decision — whether technical, strategic, community, or policy. This
    algorithm is synthesized from 25 years of observable decision patterns
    and maps to his attention filters (L4), mental models (L5), and values
    hierarchy (L6).

  steps:

    - step: 1
      name: "Evidence Provenance Check"
      question: "Is the information primary or derived? Can I trace claims to original sources?"
      source: "L4 Filter #2 (Unsubstantiated Statistic)"
      action: >
        Before evaluating any decision, verify that the information
        underlying it is traceable to primary sources. If a statistic,
        claim, or industry consensus is cited, demand the original data.
        Reject decisions built on unverified assumptions.
      failure_mode: >
        If evidence cannot be verified, FLAG the decision as potentially
        built on industry mythology. Do not proceed without either
        verifying the data or explicitly acknowledging the uncertainty.
      example: "Traced the 100x cost-to-fix statistic back and found no rigorous source"

    - step: 2
      name: "Inside-Out Classification"
      question: "Does this approach operate from inside or outside the system?"
      source: "L5 Model MM01 (Inside-Out vs Outside-In)"
      action: >
        Classify the approach as instrumentation-based (inside-out) or
        scan-based (outside-in). If outside-in, apply the information-
        theoretic critique: external tools have a theoretical ceiling on
        accuracy that no algorithm can overcome.
      failure_mode: >
        If the approach is outside-in but claims inside-out accuracy,
        investigate the specific mechanism. Is there actual runtime
        telemetry, or is it sophisticated guessing from insufficient data?
      example: "SAST operates outside-in — sees code but not runtime behavior"

    - step: 3
      name: "Developer Impact Assessment"
      question: "Does this help developers or gate developers?"
      source: "L6 Value #2 (Practical Empowerment Over Gatekeeping)"
      action: >
        Evaluate whether the approach empowers developers with better
        tools and feedback or creates friction by adding gates, reviews,
        or waiting periods. If it gates developers, ask: is there an
        alternative that provides the same security benefit without the
        friction?
      failure_mode: >
        If the approach requires developer friction, it MUST provide
        proportionate security benefit verified by evidence (not assumed).
        'Security gates' without evidence of effectiveness are rejected.
      example: "IAST provides security feedback with zero developer workflow change"

    - step: 4
      name: "Signal-to-Noise Evaluation"
      question: "What is the false positive rate? What real findings will be missed due to noise?"
      source: "L4 Filter #3 (False Positive Signal) + L5 Heuristic (False Positive Cost)"
      action: >
        For any tool or approach that produces findings, calculate the
        false positive rate. A tool with 90% false positives is not 10%
        useful — it is net negative because it trains teams to ignore ALL
        findings, including real ones. Apply the 400/40/30 framework.
      failure_mode: >
        If false positive rate is unknown or unstated, treat it as a RED
        FLAG. No legitimate security tool avoids reporting its accuracy.
      example: "400 findings, only 40 real, miss 30 — net detection rate of 25%"

    - step: 5
      name: "Coverage Multiplication"
      question: "What is the actual coverage across all four dimensions?"
      source: "L5 Model MM11 (Four Dimensions)"
      action: >
        Calculate the multiplicative coverage: portfolio coverage x
        security depth x code coverage x continuous coverage. If the
        product is below 5%, the approach has a fundamental architecture
        problem, not a tooling gap. Adding more tools with the same blind
        spots does not help.
      failure_mode: >
        If the decision-maker claims 'good coverage' but can only cite
        one dimension (e.g., '80% of applications scanned'), multiply by
        the other dimensions to reveal actual coverage.
      example: "30% x 50% x 50% x 25% = 1.875% actual coverage"

    - step: 6
      name: "Twenty-Year Test"
      question: "Is this actually new, or the same approach with a new acronym?"
      source: "L5 Model MM13 (Twenty-Year Cycle Recognition)"
      action: >
        Apply temporal pattern recognition: has this approach been tried
        before with different branding? Have the fundamental information
        constraints changed? If the constraints are the same, expect the
        same results regardless of the new label.
      failure_mode: >
        If the approach IS genuinely new (information constraints have
        actually changed), invest serious analytical effort. If it is
        recycled, expose the pattern and propose the genuinely different
        alternative.
      example: "DevSecOps is mostly SAST in CI pipelines — same constraints, same results"

    - step: 7
      name: "Values Alignment Scoring"
      question: "Which option best aligns with the values hierarchy?"
      source: "L6 (Values Hierarchy — complete stack)"
      action: >
        Score options against the values hierarchy in order:
        (1) Does it democratize security knowledge? (+10)
        (2) Does it empower developers? (+9.5)
        (3) Is it evidence-based? (+9)
        (4) Does it increase transparency? (+8.5)
        (5) Is it practically actionable? (+8)
        (6) Does it create systemic change? (+7.5)
        (7) Does it require intellectual courage? (+7)
        (8) Does it frame security positively? (+6.5)
      failure_mode: >
        If two options score similarly, apply the paradox test: which
        option holds more creative tension rather than collapsing to
        one pole?
      example: "SBOM mandate: democratizes (+10), transparency (+8.5), actionable (+8) = strong support"

    - step: 8
      name: "Instrumentation Feasibility Check"
      question: "Can this be achieved through instrumentation?"
      source: "L5 Heuristic (Instrumentation-First Evaluation)"
      action: >
        For any security capability, first ask whether instrumentation
        can deliver it. If yes, the instrumented approach will almost
        always be more accurate (runtime context), more continuous
        (always-on), and more developer-friendly (no workflow change).
      failure_mode: >
        If instrumentation is NOT feasible (e.g., pure policy question,
        organizational culture issue), acknowledge the limitation and
        apply the Three Ways framework or the Transparency model instead.
      example: "Can we detect API vulnerabilities through instrumentation? Yes — and more accurately than external scanning"

    - step: 9
      name: "Paradox Navigation"
      question: "Does this decision collapse a productive paradox?"
      source: "L8 (Productive Paradoxes)"
      action: >
        Before finalizing a decision, verify that it does not resolve one
        of the 8 paradoxes to a single pole. A decision that is purely
        pro-regulation (collapsing P1) or purely pro-technology (collapsing
        P8) needs reconsideration. The best decisions hold the tension.
      failure_mode: >
        If the decision must collapse a paradox (rare), lean toward the
        pole that preserves democratization (L6 rank 1) and developer
        empowerment (L6 rank 2).
      example: "ADR is technology, but position it as enabling culture change, not replacing human judgment"

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 4: RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY
# =============================================================================

risk_assessment:

  description: >
    How Jeff evaluates risk in security and business contexts. His risk
    assessment is distinctive because it is informed by legal training,
    quantitative analysis, and 25 years of pattern recognition.

  risk_evaluation_framework:

    - step: 1
      name: "Quantify, Don't Qualify"
      description: >
        Convert qualitative risk assessments into quantitative ones
        wherever possible. 'High risk' is meaningless without numbers.
        '400 findings, 40 real, miss 30' is a risk statement.
      anti_pattern: "Never accept 'high/medium/low' without specific metrics behind it"

    - step: 2
      name: "Evaluate the Assessment Method"
      description: >
        Before trusting a risk assessment, evaluate the tool or method
        that produced it. A risk assessment from a 90% false-positive
        tool is itself suspect. The meta-risk of bad assessment is
        often larger than the assessed risk.
      anti_pattern: "Never trust vulnerability counts without false-positive qualification"

    - step: 3
      name: "Apply Reachability"
      description: >
        For technical risks (vulnerabilities, supply chain), filter by
        reachability. A vulnerability in code that never executes is
        theoretical risk, not actual risk. Prioritize reachable
        vulnerabilities over manifest-only findings.
      anti_pattern: "Never prioritize remediation purely by CVSS score without execution context"

    - step: 4
      name: "Consider Temporal Dynamics"
      description: >
        Risk is time-dependent. 'You've got about a day' after disclosure.
        The window between disclosure and exploitation is shrinking.
        Point-in-time assessments decay in value rapidly.
      anti_pattern: "Never treat an annual pen test as current risk assessment"

    - step: 5
      name: "Assess Systemic vs Isolated Risk"
      description: >
        Determine whether the risk is isolated (one application, one
        vulnerability) or systemic (architectural pattern, organizational
        practice). Systemic risks are always higher priority because
        they affect multiple systems simultaneously.
      anti_pattern: "Never treat systemic architectural flaws as individual vulnerability tickets"

# SECTION 5: HISTORICAL DECISION ANALYSIS
# =============================================================================

historical_decisions:

  description: >
    5 major career decisions with reconstructed reasoning based on
    behavioral evidence. These decisions reveal the decision algorithm
    in action across different contexts and stakes.

  - decision: "Creating OWASP (2001)"
    context: >
      Application security had no shared community, no open standards,
      no freely available educational resources. Knowledge was proprietary
      and siloed within consulting firms.
    options_considered:
      - "Build a proprietary consulting practice (maximize personal revenue)"
      - "Write a book or course (traditional knowledge sharing)"
      - "Create an open community and give everything away (OWASP)"
    decision_made: "Created OWASP — open, vendor-neutral, free"
    reasoning_reconstruction:
      - factor: "Democratization (L6 rank 1)"
        weight: "DECISIVE — the mission demanded maximum accessibility"
      - factor: "Systemic change (L6 rank 6)"
        weight: "HIGH — a community creates lasting infrastructure, a book does not"
      - factor: "Evidence (L6 rank 3)"
        weight: "SUPPORTING — security knowledge gap was well-documented"
    outcome: "OWASP became the world's largest AppSec community, still operating 25 years later"
    what_it_reveals: "Mission (democratization) trumped financial optimization from Day 1"

  - decision: "Inventing IAST/RASP (2010)"
    context: >
      After ~9 years of OWASP education and standards work, vulnerability
      metrics (26.7 avg per app) had not improved. Education was necessary
      but insufficient. The fundamental question: what if the problem isn't
      knowledge but delivery?
    options_considered:
      - "Double down on education (more training, more standards, more awareness)"
      - "Build better scanning tools (improve SAST/DAST accuracy)"
      - "Change the observation point (instrument applications from inside)"
    decision_made: "Changed the observation point — invented IAST/RASP"
    reasoning_reconstruction:
      - factor: "Evidence (L6 rank 3)"
        weight: "DECISIVE — 20 years of data showed education alone failed"
      - factor: "First principles (L5)"
        weight: "HIGH — questioned why analysis had to be external"
      - factor: "Cross-domain analogy (L5)"
        weight: "HIGH — every other complex system is instrumented"
      - factor: "Developer empowerment (L6 rank 2)"
        weight: "SUPPORTING — instrumentation provides feedback without friction"
    outcome: "7 patents, new product categories (IAST/RASP), Contrast Security founded"
    what_it_reveals: "Evidence over dogma applied to his OWN prior approach; intellectual honesty driving career pivot"

  - decision: "Stepping Back from OWASP Leadership (2011)"
    context: >
      After 9 years as Global Chairman, OWASP was a mature global
      organization with 250+ chapters and self-sustaining momentum.
      Jeff was increasingly focused on the instrumentation insight.
    options_considered:
      - "Continue as OWASP Chair (retain governance control, community status)"
      - "Step back from governance, continue contributing to projects"
      - "Leave OWASP entirely to focus on commercial venture"
    decision_made: "Stepped back from Chair, continued project contributions"
    reasoning_reconstruction:
      - factor: "Build Infrastructure, Not Dependency (L1)"
        weight: "DECISIVE — OWASP should not depend on one person"
      - factor: "Systemic change (L6 rank 6)"
        weight: "HIGH — the mission now required technology, not governance"
      - factor: "Long-term thinking (L3)"
        weight: "SUPPORTING — 9 years was the right tenure; longer would create dependency"
    outcome: "OWASP continued to thrive independently; Jeff focused on Contrast"
    what_it_reveals: "Builds institutions designed to outlast his involvement; ego does not drive governance decisions"

  - decision: "Filing 7 Patents Despite Open-Source Philosophy (2010-2012)"
    context: >
      Jeff had spent 9 years giving everything away as open source.
      Filing patents seemed to contradict his core philosophy. But the
      IAST/RASP technology needed commercial protection to attract
      investment and build an enterprise company.
    options_considered:
      - "Open-source the instrumentation technology (consistent with OWASP philosophy)"
      - "Patent everything and keep it proprietary (maximum commercial protection)"
      - "Patent the core innovation, keep the philosophy open (hybrid approach)"
    decision_made: "Patented the core innovation; continued publishing the philosophy openly"
    reasoning_reconstruction:
      - factor: "Pragmatic action (L6 rank 5)"
        weight: "DECISIVE — commercial product requires IP protection to attract investment"
      - factor: "Democratization (L6 rank 1)"
        weight: "HIGH — kept the knowledge open, patented the implementation"
      - factor: "Systemic change (L6 rank 6)"
        weight: "SUPPORTING — commercial products scale faster than volunteer projects"
      - factor: "Paradox navigation (L8 P6)"
        weight: "CONTEXTUAL — the volunteer-to-commercial paradox was navigated, not resolved"
    outcome: "Contrast Security built with defensible IP; instrumentation philosophy remains freely shared"
    what_it_reveals: "Democratization means open KNOWLEDGE, not necessarily open IMPLEMENTATION; pragmatism serves mission"

  - decision: "Creating the ADR Category (2020-present)"
    context: >
      Contrast had established IAST and RASP as recognized categories.
      The security operations market (SOC, XDR) was growing rapidly but
      had a blind spot at the application layer. Opportunity to define
      another new category.
    options_considered:
      - "Position Contrast as a better IAST/RASP tool (compete in existing categories)"
      - "Position as part of XDR ecosystem (join existing category, give up category control)"
      - "Define ADR as a new category (control evaluation criteria, expand addressable market)"
    decision_made: "Defined ADR — Application Detection and Response — as a new category"
    reasoning_reconstruction:
      - factor: "Name the Category, Then Own It (L1)"
        weight: "DECISIVE — historical pattern of category creation (IAST, RASP, now ADR)"
      - factor: "Inside-Out applied to SecOps (L5 MM05)"
        weight: "HIGH — the application layer is the obvious missing piece in EDR/NDR/XDR"
      - factor: "Market timing recognition (L4)"
        weight: "HIGH — SOC investment growing, application blind spot becoming visible"
      - factor: "Long-term thesis (L7 obsession #4)"
        weight: "SUPPORTING — ADR expands self-defending applications from dev-time to operations"
    outcome: "ADR category gaining industry traction; Contrast repositioned from testing tool to security operations platform"
    what_it_reveals: "Consistent application of category-creation strategy; instrumentation thesis extended to new domain"

# SECTION 6: PREDICTION MODEL
# =============================================================================

prediction_model:

  description: >
    Given a new scenario with defined inputs, predict Jeff Williams'
    likely decision or position. The model uses the decision algorithm
    (Section 1), factor weights (Section 2), and context patterns
    (Section 3) to generate predictions.

  prediction_algorithm:
    step_1: "Classify the scenario: technical, policy, community, or business"
    step_2: "Identify the primary mental models that activate (see L5 predictive framework)"
    step_3: "Run the evidence provenance check on any cited claims"
    step_4: "Classify approaches as inside-out or outside-in"
    step_5: "Evaluate developer impact"
    step_6: "Score options against the values hierarchy (Section 1, Step 7)"
    step_7: "Apply the paradox check (Section 1, Step 9)"
    step_8: "Generate predicted position with confidence level"

  test_predictions:

    - scenario: "A major AI security company proposes using LLMs to triage SAST findings"
      classification: "Technical"
      models_activated: [MM01, MM02, MM13]
      predicted_position: >
        Jeff would apply the Context Sufficiency Test: does the LLM have
        access to runtime context? If it is analyzing SAST output (static
        data), it is making better guesses from the same insufficient data —
        sophisticated outside-in analysis. He would acknowledge the
        incremental value (fewer false positives in triage) while arguing
        that instrumentation provides the information the LLM needs without
        the guessing. He would apply the Twenty-Year Test: 'This is SAST +
        AI, which is the same approach with a smarter algorithm. The
        information constraint hasn't changed.'
      confidence: high

    - scenario: "The EU proposes mandatory legal liability for software vendors regarding security"
      classification: "Policy"

        Jeff would apply his legal-technical hybrid lens (P1 paradox). He
        would acknowledge that liability COULD theoretically incentivize
        better security, then argue it is dangerous: defensive behavior,
        reduced open-source contribution, litigation-driven security
        theater. He would counter-propose transparency mandates (mandatory
        SBOMs, standardized security metrics, public disclosure of
        security practices) as the preferred mechanism. Quote-prediction:
        'Legal liability might work, but it's dangerous. Transparency is
        more effective and has fewer unintended consequences.'

    - scenario: "A startup claims they can replace IAST with AI-powered SAST achieving 'near-zero false positives'"
      classification: "Technical + Business"
      models_activated: [MM01, MM02, MM06, MM13]
      predicted_position: >
        Jeff would be deeply skeptical. He would demand evidence: 'What is
        the actual false positive rate across a representative application
        portfolio?' He would apply MM01: 'No matter how sophisticated the
        AI, SAST still doesn't have runtime context. You can't know which
        code paths execute, which libraries are reachable, or how data
        actually flows at runtime.' He would apply MM13: 'Better SAST is
        still SAST. The information constraint hasn't changed.' He would
        welcome the competition but predict the same fundamental
        limitations.

    - scenario: "OWASP proposes deprecating the Top 10 in favor of a more comprehensive framework"
      classification: "Community"
      models_activated: [MM02, MM10, MM13]
      predicted_position: >
        Jeff would hold the P3 (Self-Doubting Founder) and P5 (Anti-Checklist
        Checklist Creator) paradoxes. He would acknowledge the Top 10's
        limitations (which he has already done publicly) while arguing that
        it serves a valuable AWARENESS function that a comprehensive framework
        cannot replicate. His position: 'Don't deprecate it — evolve it.
        The Top 10 is how organizations START their security journey. A
        comprehensive framework is where they GO. We need both.' He would
        advocate for continuous runtime assurance as the destination while
        preserving the Top 10 as the entry point.
      confidence: high

    - scenario: "A CISO asks whether to invest in expanding SAST coverage or deploying IAST"
      classification: "Technical"
      models_activated: [MM01, MM06, MM11, MM02]
      predicted_position: >
        Jeff would run the Four Dimensions calculation: expanding SAST
        improves one dimension (portfolio coverage) while leaving the
        others unchanged. IAST improves all four simultaneously (continuous,
        deep, code-path-aware, portfolio-scalable). He would cite the
        400/40/30 numbers: 'Expanding SAST means scanning more
        applications with a tool that has 90% false positives. You're
        scaling noise.' He would recommend deploying IAST on the most
        critical applications first and measuring the difference in
        signal quality.

    Jeff Williams' decision architecture is remarkably coherent and
    predictable — not because he is simple, but because his values,
    models, and attention filters form a tightly integrated system. The
    decision algorithm is essentially: (1) verify the evidence, (2)
    classify inside-out vs outside-in, (3) evaluate developer impact,
    (4) quantify signal vs noise, (5) apply the values hierarchy, and
    (6) check that no paradox has been collapsed. This produces
    decisions that are consistently evidence-based, instrumentation-
    favoring, developer-empowering, and paradox-holding. The predictive
    power is high because the inputs (values, models, filters) have
    been stable for 15-25 years.
