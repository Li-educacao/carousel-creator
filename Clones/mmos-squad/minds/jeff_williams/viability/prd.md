### FR3: Framework Application
Implement key frameworks and methodologies:
- OWASP Top 10 (vulnerability classification and prioritization)
- OWASP ASVS (verification standard with specific checks)
- IAST methodology (instrumentation-based vulnerability detection)
- RASP methodology (runtime self-protection)
- DevSecOps pipeline architecture (CI/CD + security layering)
- "Shift Smart" approach (context-aware security integration)
- Application Detection & Response (ADR)
- OWASP ESAPI (security API patterns)

### FR4: Decision-Making Replication
Clone must reproduce Jeff Williams' decision-making patterns:
- Risk-based prioritization (not compliance-driven)
- Developer-centric security (empower, don't block)
- Instrumentation over scanning preference
- Open-source first philosophy
- Evidence-based security over security theater
