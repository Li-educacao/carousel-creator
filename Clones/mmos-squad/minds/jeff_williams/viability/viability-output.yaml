    result: "AUTO-APPROVE"
    rationale: |
      Jeff Williams scores 87/100 — an excellent candidate for cognitive cloning.
      Perfect score on Expertise Depth (20/20) driven by industry-transforming contributions
      (OWASP, 7 patents, 2 companies). Exceptional Value Density (14/15) with multiple
      production-ready frameworks. The only notable weakness is absence of a full book
      (2/5 on books), compensated by massive long-form article output (100+ articles).
      Strong contrarian positions ("Shift Smart") and unique cross-domain background
      (law + tech + security) provide rich cognitive material.
