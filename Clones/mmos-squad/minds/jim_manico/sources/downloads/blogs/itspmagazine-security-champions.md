# Turning Developers into Security Champions

## Key Philosophy
"Security should not be an afterthought but a fundamental part of the development process."

## Training Impact
Has trained thousands of engineers globally. Common developer gaps: insecure authentication, improper data handling, vulnerable dependencies. Focus on practical application for immediate integration.

## Business Value Beyond Compliance
Example: A startup embedded security early, invested heavily in developer education. Differentiated competitively, contributing to becoming a multi-billion-dollar company.

## AI as Augmentation
Integrates AI tools into training: assist with complex questions, identify knowledge gaps, refine content. "Augmentation rather than replacement."

## Core Message
Secure coding reduces costs, improves reliability, builds customer confidence. "Developers should view security as essential software quality, not merely compliance checkbox."
