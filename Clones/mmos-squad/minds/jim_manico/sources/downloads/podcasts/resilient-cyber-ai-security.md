# Resilient Cyber: Jim Manico on AI and Software Security

## AI as Force Multiplier
Demonstrated accomplishing "the work of teams of people on his own" and completing tasks that "used to take tens of hundreds of hours" by leveraging AI agents and frontier models.

## Security-Centric Prompting
Adding "security-centric prompts and guidance" directly impacts how models produce code, reducing "vulnerability velocity."

## Systemic Risks and Opportunities
Concerns about developer adoption without proper security measures, but solutions through prompt libraries and enterprise controls enabling "systemic secure software development within the enterprise."

## Workforce Implications
Developers need to "upskill to stay relevant (and employable)" as AI-driven development becomes prevalent.

## Beyond AppSec
Opportunities in "GRC and SecOps" domains where AI could enhance cybersecurity practices.
