# Absolute AppSec Ep. 27: Secure Code Best Practices

## Jim Manico's Career Journey
- Began as Java developer in late 1990s (decade of programming)
- Pivotal moment: met Stephen Northcutt, who recognized need for security from developer perspective
- SANS: intensive 100-hour work weeks, deep AppSec immersion
- Aspect Security: software development under NDA
- WhiteHat Security: acquired his static analysis startup; evangelist role
- Manicode Security: CEO/Founder, modular developer training approach

## Teaching Philosophy
"When you're on stage teaching, it's half performance, half knowledge... I want them to walk away being lifted up and excited."

Sees training as "both personal mission and industry obligation," particularly when qualified AppSec educators were scarce.

## XSS Discussion
XSS persistence reflects problematic industry economics — more financial incentive for discovering vulnerabilities than resolving them.

"You have to escape. You have to use frameworks correctly. You have to sanitize HTML. You have to get CSP in place... get it right everywhere."

## Evolution Since 2018
- SQL injection largely curbed through secure-by-default frameworks and ORM
- XSS remains widespread due to complexity
- Modern defenses: CSP, DOMPurify, auto-escaping templating engines
- React sandboxing; Svelte and SolidJS more secure-by-default
- XSS persists in SPAs and DOM-heavy frontends

## Current Training (2025)
- "Practical Secure Code Review - AI Enhanced" (virtual)
- "Harnessing LLMs for Application Security" (DEF CON, Las Vegas)
