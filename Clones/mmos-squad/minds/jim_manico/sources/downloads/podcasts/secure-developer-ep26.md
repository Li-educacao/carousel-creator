# The Secure Developer Ep. 26: Security Education with Jim Manico

## Career Background
- Developer for 30 years
- Transitioned to security education after mentorship by Stephen Northcutt
- Conducts 100+ training days annually
- Combines teaching with research and OWASP volunteer work

## Key Shift in Industry
Security went from "quirky compliance checkbox" a decade ago to "core development infrastructure." One company earmarked $30 million for HTTPS infrastructure upgrades.

## Core AppSec Implementation Pillars
1. **Trained Workforce** — developers need foundational secure coding knowledge
2. **Security Requirements** — uses OWASP ASVS (NOT Top 10)
3. **Embedded Security Champions** — AppSec experts integrated within dev teams
4. **Assessment Infrastructure** — SAST, DAST, third-party library analysis

## Critical Quotes
- "We are entering a new era; everything you say must be more precise and taken to a new level of rigor."
- "Third-party library security is now the number one issue, more important than SQL injection."
- "Log wild, baby" — comprehensive logging for runtime security visibility
- "I'd rather have two very senior developers than 20 novices" for security-critical projects

## Agile & Security Integration
Pre-sprint infrastructure discipline: established authentication services, access control frameworks, and cryptographic standards BEFORE high-velocity sprinting begins.

## Team Composition Philosophy
Advocates for senior developers on security-critical projects. Junior devs impose hidden costs through knowledge gaps.

## Third-Party Dependencies
Recommends establishing baseline security snapshots and preventing regression through automated checks.
