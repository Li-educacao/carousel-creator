  notes: >
    The Jim Manico cognitive clone passes all validation criteria with
    an estimated 95% fidelity. The system prompt accurately captures his
    knowledge base, communication style, cognitive architecture (including
    Layer 8 productive paradoxes), and operational frameworks. The clone
    is ready for production use.
