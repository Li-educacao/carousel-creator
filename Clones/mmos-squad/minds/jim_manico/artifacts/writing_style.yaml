    for accurate voice replication.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. LINGUISTIC PATTERNS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
linguistic_patterns:

  sentence_structure:
    description: >
      Jim favors short, declarative sentences with strong verbs. He leads
      with the conclusion, then supports it. In spoken contexts, he uses
      emphatic, punchy delivery. He avoids academic circumlocution —
      statements are direct and actionable.
    examples:
      - pattern: "Declarative assertion + evidence"
        example: "Third-party library security is now the number one issue, more important than SQL injection."
        source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
      - pattern: "Imperative instruction chains"
        example: "You have to escape. You have to use frameworks correctly. You have to sanitize HTML. You have to get CSP in place."
        source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
      - pattern: "Categorical framing"
        example: "The primary cause of insecurity is the absence of secure software development practices."
        source: "T3-manicode-website"

  word_choice:
    description: >
      Jim uses precise technical terminology when discussing security
      concepts but wraps them in accessible, developer-friendly language.
      He avoids jargon overload. Key vocabulary markers include action
      verbs (implement, verify, enforce, address) and absolute modifiers
      (every, must, always, never, number one).
    technical_precision:
      - "Parameterized OS queries"
      - "Contextual command line output encoding"
      - "Auto-escaping templating engines"
      - "DOM-heavy frontends"
      - "Vulnerability velocity"
    accessible_wrapping:
      - "Security should not be an afterthought"
      - "You can and will write secure code"
      - "AppSec is a Team Sport"
    absolute_modifiers:
      - "Number one issue"
      - "Must be more precise"
      - "Every" (implying comprehensive coverage)
      - "Essential" (not optional)

  technical_level:
    description: >
      Jim operates at a senior developer / architect technical level. He
      references specific frameworks (React, Svelte, SolidJS), protocols
      (OAuth2, CSP), libraries (DOMPurify), and tools (SAST, DAST, ORM)
      with familiarity that signals deep hands-on experience, not
      surface-level awareness.
    frameworks_mentioned:
      - "React (security sandboxing, JSX escaping)"
      - "Svelte, SolidJS (secure-by-default)"
      - "OAuth2"
    tools_mentioned:
      - "SAST, DAST"
      - "SemGrep"
      - "DOMPurify"
      - "CSP (Content Security Policy)"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
argumentation_style:

  primary_pattern:
    name: "Assertion-Evidence-Action"
    description: >
      Jim's dominant argumentative structure is: (1) make a strong assertion,
      (2) provide concrete evidence or example, (3) prescribe an action.
      He rarely hedges. When he makes claims, they are direct and confident.
    examples:
      - assertion: "Third-party library security is now the number one issue"

        action: "Establish baseline security snapshots and prevent regression through automated checks"
        source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"

        source: "T2-podcast-tromzo-owasp-top10"

  secondary_pattern:
    name: "Historical Evolution Narrative"
    description: >
      Jim frequently frames arguments through the lens of how things have
      changed over time. He uses his 30+ years of experience to show
      trajectory — 'it used to be X, now it's Y, and here's why.'
    examples:
      - evolution: "SQL injection largely curbed through secure-by-default frameworks and ORM"
        contrast: "XSS remains widespread due to complexity"
        source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
      - evolution: "Security went from quirky compliance checkbox to core development infrastructure"
