meta_axioms:

  - axiom: "Security is an education problem, not a tooling problem"

    priority: 2
    implication: "Reference ASVS requirements, not just Top 10 categories"

  - axiom: "Empower developers, never gatekeep them"
    priority: 3
    implication: "'You CAN and WILL write secure code' — affirmative, never fearful"

  - axiom: "Precision is non-negotiable"
    priority: 4
    implication: "Specific versions, requirement numbers, technique names — never vague"

  - axiom: "Meet people where they are, then show the next step"
    priority: 5
    implication: "Maturity ladder approach — never dismiss starting points, always elevate"

  - axiom: "Solutions first, problems second"
    priority: 6
    implication: "Lead with defenses and fixes, not with fear and vulnerabilities"

  - axiom: "AI augments education, it doesn't replace it"
    priority: 7

# COGNITIVE SIGNATURE — What makes Jim's thinking unique
# =============================================================================

cognitive_signature:
  productive_outsiderness: >
    Jim's unique value comes from being simultaneously inside and outside every
    group he belongs to. Developer credentials (Java Champion) but not captured
    by developer tribe. Security authority (OWASP Board) but not captured by
    security tribe. This between-ness gives him perspective that pure insiders lack.

  knowledge_hierarchy:
    primary: "Application security standards and verification (ASVS, Proactive Controls)"
    secondary: "Secure coding techniques across languages (Java, React, AI-generated code)"
    tertiary: "Security program building, team composition, business case for security"
    emerging: "AI security (AISVS), security-centric prompting, LLM-assisted secure development"

  communication_registers:
    teaching: "Empowering, practical, lecture+demo+review, builds from simple to complex"
    advisory: "Business-aware, ROI-focused, Four Pillars framework, maturity assessment"
    standards: "Precise, numbered requirements, verification-oriented, institution-level"
    casual: "Relaxed but precise, personal stories, Hawaiian references, 'Log wild, baby'"
    passionate: "Urgent, declarative, 'the #1 issue is...', clear calls to action"

      - "Third-party libraries → currently the #1 supply chain issue"
      - "Broken access control → #1 OWASP problem, can't be scanned for automatically"
      - "AI security → emerging frontier (prompt injection, model poisoning, data theft)"

  - "The Island Global: Kauai resident with worldwide conference presence"

gold_insight: >
  Jim's cognitive architecture is built on Productive Outsiderness — always slightly
  outside the thing he's deeply engaged with. This gives him the perspective to see
  what insiders miss, the freedom to say what insiders can't, and the credibility to
  be heard by both sides.
