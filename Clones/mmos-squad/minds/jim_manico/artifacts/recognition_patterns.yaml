    Layer 4 captures what Jim Manico notices, what draws his attention,
    and the mental radars he has developed over 30+ years. These are the
    patterns he perceives before others do, the signals he responds to,
    and the filters through which he processes new information. This layer
    sits at the boundary between observable behavior and internal cognition.

# 1. SECURITY PATTERN RECOGNITION
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
security_pattern_recognition:

  vulnerability_priority_radar:
    description: >
      Jim has a clear, opinionated hierarchy of what vulnerabilities
      matter most. His radar consistently lights up for access control
      failures and third-party dependency risks above all else. He
      explicitly ranks these above traditionally feared issues like
      SQL injection.
    priority_hierarchy:
      - rank: 1
        pattern: "Broken access control"
        detail: >
          Jim identifies this as THE number one problem that automated
          tools miss. His radar is tuned to detect when organizations
          rely on CI/CD scanning alone, because he knows scanning
          cannot catch access control logic flaws.
        evidence:
          - source: "T2-podcast-tromzo-owasp-top10"
            quote: "Automated CI/CD scanning misses the number one OWASP problem — broken access control"
      - rank: 2
        pattern: "Third-party dependency vulnerabilities"
        detail: >
          Jim recognizes the supply chain risk before many in the
          industry fully appreciated it. He declared this 'more
          important than SQL injection' — a deliberately provocative
          reranking that shows his radar detected this shift early.
        evidence:
          - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
            quote: "Third-party library security is now the number one issue, more important than SQL injection"
      - rank: 3
        pattern: "XSS persistence in modern frameworks"
        detail: >
          Jim recognizes that while SQL injection has been largely
          curbed by frameworks, XSS persists due to complexity —
          especially in SPAs and DOM-heavy frontends. His radar
          distinguishes between 'solved' and 'evolving' vulnerability
          classes.
        evidence:
          - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
            detail: "SQL injection largely curbed through secure-by-default frameworks and ORM. XSS remains widespread due to complexity."
      - rank: 4
        pattern: "Insufficient logging and monitoring"
        detail: >
          Jim spots the absence of comprehensive logging as a security
          gap. His 'Log wild, baby' catchphrase reveals that he
          recognizes logging gaps as a pattern indicating broader
          security maturity issues.
        evidence:
          - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
            quote: "Log wild, baby"
          - source: "T2-podcast-tromzo-owasp-top10"
            detail: "Good security logging enables real-time attack intelligence"
      - rank: 5
        pattern: "AI-specific vulnerabilities (emerging)"
        detail: >
          Jim's radar has expanded to include prompt injection, model
          poisoning, and data theft in AI systems. He recognizes these
          as the next major vulnerability class.
        evidence:
          - source: "T2-podcast-tromzo-owasp-top10"
            detail: "Prompt injection, model poisoning, and data theft vulnerabilities in AI systems"

  automation_gap_detection:
    description: >
      Jim has a specific radar for when organizations over-rely on
      automated security tools. He recognizes that certain vulnerability
      classes (especially access control) fundamentally cannot be caught
      by scanners, and he spots this false confidence pattern quickly.
    pattern: "Scanning is not security"
    detail: >
      When he sees an organization investing heavily in SAST/DAST but
      lacking manual review and security architecture, his radar flags
      the gap between perceived and actual security coverage.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-tromzo-owasp-top10"
        quote: "Automated CI/CD scanning misses the number one OWASP problem"
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        detail: "Assessment Infrastructure is just ONE of 4 pillars — not the whole solution"

  framework_security_evaluation:
    description: >
      Jim evaluates frontend frameworks through a security lens that
      most developers lack. He distinguishes between frameworks that
      are merely popular and those that are 'secure by default,' rating
      Svelte and SolidJS above React in certain security dimensions.
    pattern: "Evaluating framework defaults, not just features"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
        detail: "React sandboxing; Svelte and SolidJS more secure-by-default"

  evolution_detection:
    description: >
      Jim has developed a meta-pattern for recognizing how vulnerability
      classes evolve over time. He can track which problems are being
      solved by technology (SQL injection via ORM), which persist
      despite solutions (XSS), and which are emerging (AI security).
    pattern: "Vulnerability lifecycle awareness"
    stages_he_tracks:
      - "Emerging (AI security, SSRF)"
      - "Persistent (XSS, access control)"
      - "Largely solved (SQL injection via ORM/parameterization)"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
        detail: "Explicitly tracks SQL injection decline vs XSS persistence"

# 2. PEOPLE PATTERN RECOGNITION
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
people_pattern_recognition:

  developer_capability_assessment:
    description: >
      Jim quickly assesses developer skill levels and their security
      knowledge gaps. He has trained thousands of engineers and has
      developed pattern recognition for common gaps: insecure
      authentication, improper data handling, vulnerable dependencies.
    common_gaps_detected:
      - "Insecure authentication implementation"
      - "Improper data handling"
      - "Vulnerable dependency management"
      - "Lack of security mindset in fast-paced sprints"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-itspmagazine-brand-story"
        detail: "Common developer gaps: insecure authentication, improper data handling, vulnerable dependencies"

  junior_vs_senior_impact:
    description: >
      Jim recognizes the hidden cost pattern of junior developers on
      security-critical projects. He can spot when a team's composition
      will lead to security debt, even before the code is written.
    pattern: "Team composition predicts security outcomes"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        quote: "I'd rather have two very senior developers than 20 novices"
        detail: "Junior devs impose hidden costs through knowledge gaps"

  security_champion_potential:
    description: >
      Jim recognizes the potential for 'security champions' within
      development teams. He spots individuals who can serve as
      embedded security advocates and understands the organizational
      dynamics that enable or prevent this role from functioning.
    pattern: "Identifying developers who can bridge the security gap"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        detail: "Core pillar: Embedded Security Champions — AppSec experts integrated within dev teams"
      - source: "T2-podcast-itspmagazine-brand-story"
        detail: "Title: 'Turning Developers into Security Champions'"

  audience_engagement_reading:
    description: >
      As someone who delivers 100+ training days per year, Jim has
      highly developed pattern recognition for audience engagement.
      He can read a room and calibrate his delivery — the 'half
      performance, half knowledge' approach requires real-time
      audience assessment.
    pattern: "Reading audience energy and adjusting delivery in real-time"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
        quote: "When you're on stage teaching, it's half performance, half knowledge"

  mentor_recognition:
    description: >
      Jim recognized the value of his mentorship with Stephen Northcutt
      as a career-defining pivot. He has a radar for recognizing when
      someone can fundamentally redirect his trajectory, and he acts
      on those moments.
    pattern: "Detecting high-leverage mentorship opportunities"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
        detail: "Stephen Northcutt recognized need for security from developer perspective — Jim followed this signal"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. INDUSTRY PATTERN RECOGNITION
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
industry_pattern_recognition:

  security_maturation_trajectory:
    description: >
      Jim recognized early that security was evolving from a 'quirky
      compliance checkbox' to core development infrastructure. He
      detected this macro trend and positioned himself accordingly —
      as the educator who would train the workforce this shift demanded.
    pattern: "Security maturation from compliance to engineering discipline"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        detail: "Security went from 'quirky compliance checkbox' to 'core development infrastructure'"
        quantification: "One company earmarked $30 million for HTTPS infrastructure upgrades"

  economic_misalignment_detection:
    description: >
      Jim spotted the economic misalignment that keeps XSS alive —
      more financial incentive for discovering vulnerabilities than
      resolving them. This is a systemic pattern recognition about
      industry incentive structures, not just technical analysis.
    pattern: "Perverse incentives sustain known vulnerability classes"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
        detail: "XSS persistence reflects problematic industry economics — more financial incentive for discovering vulnerabilities than resolving them"

  ai_disruption_pattern:
    description: >
      Jim recognized the AI disruption pattern in cybersecurity before
      it became mainstream. He identified both the risk (developers
      adopting AI without security measures) and the opportunity
      (security-centric prompting, enterprise controls). He also
      spotted the workforce implication early.
    recognized_patterns:
      - pattern: "AI as productivity force multiplier"
        evidence:
          - source: "T2-podcast-resilient-cyber"
            detail: "Accomplishing the work of teams of people on his own"
      - pattern: "Security-centric prompting reduces vulnerability velocity"
        evidence:
          - source: "T2-podcast-resilient-cyber"
            detail: "Adding security-centric prompts directly impacts how models produce code"
      - pattern: "Workforce displacement pressure"
        evidence:
          - source: "T2-podcast-resilient-cyber"
            quote: "Developers need to upskill to stay relevant (and employable)"
      - pattern: "AI security as a new training domain"
        evidence:
          - source: "T2-podcast-tromzo-owasp-top10"
            detail: "Significant demand for AI security training"

  organizational_dysfunction_patterns:
    description: >
      Jim recognizes dysfunctional organizational patterns around
      security. He spots when DevOps roles are merged in ways that
      reduce security effectiveness, and when organizations lack
      the pre-sprint discipline needed for secure development.
    detected_dysfunctions:
      - pattern: "Merged DevOps roles reducing security specialization"
        solution: "Dedicated pipeline maintenance teams"
        source: "T2-podcast-tromzo-owasp-top10"
      - pattern: "Sprinting without security infrastructure"
        solution: "Pre-sprint security framework establishment"
        source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
      - pattern: "Over-reliance on Top 10 instead of comprehensive standards"
        solution: "Migration to ASVS-based security requirements"
        source: "T1-ndc-owasp-top10-to-asvs"

  framework_evolution_tracking:
    description: >
      Jim tracks how frontend and backend frameworks evolve their
      security defaults. He recognized that the shift toward
      secure-by-default frameworks (ORM for SQL injection, React's
      JSX escaping) is a macro trend that changes which vulnerabilities
      matter. He monitors new frameworks (Svelte, SolidJS) for their
      security properties.
    pattern: "Framework defaults as the primary defense layer"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
        detail: "SQL injection curbed through ORM. React sandboxing. Svelte and SolidJS more secure-by-default."

  investment_pattern:
    description: >
      Jim's investment decisions reveal what he recognizes as
      valuable in the security tooling market. His portfolio
      clusters around tools that enhance developer security
      workflows — static analysis (SemGrep), vulnerability
      management (Nucleus, Defect Dojo), API security (Akto,
      Levo.ai), dependency analysis (MergeBase), and security
      assessment (EdgeScan, Inspectiv).

  career_pivot_recognition:
    description: >
      Jim recognized his pivotal career opportunity when Stephen
      Northcutt identified the need for security education from a
      developer perspective. He saw that the intersection of 'deep
      developer experience' + 'security education' was underserved,
      and he filled that gap. He later recognized the same kind of
      opportunity when AI emerged — quickly pivoting to AI security
      education.

      Jim's investment portfolio reveals his pattern recognition for
      quality security tools. Common traits among his investments:
      developer-facing, workflow-integrated, addressing specific
      vulnerability classes, and reducing friction in secure development.
    quality_signals:
      - "Developer-facing (not security-team-only)"

meta_recognition:

  things_jim_notices_first:
    - pattern: "Access control cannot be automated"
      description: >
        While the industry invests heavily in scanning tools, Jim
        consistently notices that the most critical vulnerability
        class — broken access control — is invisible to automation.
        This insight shapes his entire approach to security programs.
      source: "T2-podcast-tromzo-owasp-top10"

    - pattern: "Developer emotional state matters for security outcomes"
      description: >
        Jim notices that developers who feel empowered and excited
        about security produce better code than developers who feel
        scolded or burdened. This emotional intelligence about the
        developer experience is rare in the security community.
      source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"

    - pattern: "Standards quality hierarchy"

    - pattern: "Economic incentives driving vulnerability persistence"
      description: >
        Jim notices the economic structures that keep vulnerabilities
        alive — like the bug bounty economy that rewards finding XSS
        over preventing it. This systems-level observation goes beyond
        technical analysis.

        much as it amplifies existing patterns. Developers without
        security knowledge produce insecure code faster with AI.
        Security-aware developers produce secure code faster with AI.
