# 1. PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIORS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
professional_behaviors:

  teaching_behavior:
    description: >
      Jim Manico is primarily a security educator. He conducts 100+ training
      days per year, making teaching his dominant professional activity. His
      teaching is live, interactive, and modular — combining lecture,
      security testing demonstration, and code review in each session.
    frequency: "100+ days annually"
    format:
      - "Live instructor-led (in-person and virtual)"
      - "Downloadable courses"
      - "Conference talks (60-90 minute sessions)"
      - "Full-day workshops (09:00-17:30)"
      - "Deep-dive lectures (90 minutes)"
    methodology: "Lecture + security testing demonstration + code review"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        quote: "Conducts 100+ training days annually"
      - source: "T3-manicode-website"
        quote: "Manicode classes are a combination of lecture, security testing demonstration, and code review"

        detail: "One-day hands-on workshop at SecAppDev 2025 (09:00-17:30) plus a 90-minute deep-dive lecture"

  performance_orientation:
    description: >
      Jim explicitly frames teaching as part performance, part knowledge
      transfer. He aims to leave audiences emotionally elevated and excited
      about security, not just informed. This is a deliberate theatrical
      approach to education.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
        quote: "When you're on stage teaching, it's half performance, half knowledge... I want them to walk away being lifted up and excited."
      - source: "T2-podcast-virtual-ciso-ep19"
        detail: "Host noted his energy as surpassing typical industry enthusiasm levels"

  owasp_volunteer_leadership:
    description: >
      Jim holds leadership positions across multiple OWASP projects
      simultaneously, maintaining long-term stewardship rather than
      one-off contributions. He co-leads ASVS, co-leads the Proactive
      Controls, and co-leads the Cheatsheet Series.
    roles:
      - project: "OWASP ASVS"
        role: "Project Leader / Lead Author (v2, 2014; continuing leader through v5.0.0)"
        evidence:
          - source: "T1-owasp-asvs"
            detail: "Listed as project leader alongside Daniel Cuthbert, Elar Lang, Josh Grossman"
      - project: "OWASP Proactive Controls"
        role: "Project Leader / Original Author (v1.0, 2014)"
        evidence:
          - source: "T1-owasp-proactive-controls"
            detail: "Project leader alongside Andreas Happe, Katy Anton. Created v1.0 with Jim Bird"
      - project: "OWASP Cheatsheet Series"
        role: "Co-lead"
        evidence:
          - source: "T3-secappdev-2025-bio"
            detail: "Co-leads OWASP ASVS and Cheatsheet Series"
    pattern: >
      Sustained multi-year commitment to OWASP projects (2014-2025+),
      not episodic involvement. This is a defining behavioral trait.

  conference_circuit:
    description: >
      Jim maintains a heavy conference speaking schedule across major
      security and developer conferences globally. He appears at both
      security-focused events (DEF CON, AppSec conferences) and
      developer-focused events (NDC, SecAppDev).
    observed_events:
      - "NDC Conferences (developer-focused)"
      - "SecAppDev 2025 (Leuven, Belgium)"
      - "DEF CON (Las Vegas)"
      - "Global AppSec Barcelona (OWASP flagship)"
      - "Various podcast appearances (Secure Developer, Absolute AppSec, Resilient Cyber, Virtual CISO, Tromzo)"
    evidence:
      - source: "T3-secappdev-2025-bio"
        detail: "Two sessions at SecAppDev 2025"
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
        detail: "DEF CON training course listed"
      - source: "T1-owasp-asvs"
        detail: "ASVS 5.0.0 released at Global AppSec Barcelona"
    pattern: >
      Bridges the security-developer conference divide. Does not confine
      himself to security-only events — deliberately seeks developer
      audiences.

  company_leadership:
    description: >
      Founder and CEO of Manicode Security, a training-focused company.
      The company is essentially a vehicle for his educational mission
      rather than a typical security consultancy.
    company: "Manicode Security"
    role: "Founder / CEO"
    focus: "Secure coding education for developers, architects, and AI systems"
    tagline: "You can and will write secure code"
    evidence:
      - source: "T3-manicode-website"
        quote: "You can and will write secure code"
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
        detail: "Founded Manicode Security with modular developer training approach"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. DECISION-MAKING PATTERNS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
decision_making_patterns:

  asvs_over_top_10:
    description: >
      Consistently and repeatedly advocates for OWASP ASVS over the OWASP
      Top 10 as the actual security standard to use. This is not a casual
      preference but a core decision principle he returns to across
      multiple contexts.
    evidence:
      - source: "T1-ndc-owasp-top10-to-asvs"
        quote: "OWASP Top 10 = awareness tool (starting point). OWASP ASVS = verification standard (comprehensive security)."
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        detail: "Uses OWASP ASVS (NOT Top 10) for security requirements"
    pattern: >
      Hierarchical thinking — categorizes tools by their appropriate use
      level (awareness vs. verification) rather than dismissing the lesser
      tool entirely.

  senior_over_quantity:
    description: >
      When making team composition decisions, Jim consistently favors
      fewer senior developers over many juniors for security-critical work.
      This reveals a quality-over-quantity decision heuristic.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        quote: "I'd rather have two very senior developers than 20 novices"
    pattern: >
      Pragmatic cost-benefit thinking. Recognizes hidden costs of
      knowledge gaps in junior developers on security-critical projects.

  infrastructure_before_velocity:
    description: >
      Advocates establishing security infrastructure (auth services, access
      control frameworks, crypto standards) BEFORE beginning high-velocity
      agile sprints. Pre-sprint discipline over move-fast-and-fix-later.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        detail: "Pre-sprint infrastructure discipline: established authentication services, access control frameworks, and cryptographic standards BEFORE high-velocity sprinting"
    pattern: >
      Front-loads foundational work. Does not trust emergent security
      practices in fast-paced sprints.

  practical_over_theoretical:
    description: >
      Consistently prioritizes practical, immediately applicable advice
      over theoretical or academic security concepts. Training focuses
      on "immediate integration" and hands-on techniques.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-itspmagazine-brand-story"
        detail: "Focus on practical application for immediate integration"
      - source: "T3-manicode-website"
        detail: "Courses are intensive, interactive, and customizable providing essential application security training"
      - source: "T2-podcast-virtual-ciso-ep19"
        detail: "Prioritizes practical, understandable advice"

  ai_as_augmentation_not_replacement:
    description: >
      When confronted with AI disruption, Jim's decision pattern is to
      integrate and augment rather than resist or fully automate. He
      applies AI to enhance his existing training methodology.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-itspmagazine-brand-story"
        quote: "Augmentation rather than replacement"
      - source: "T2-podcast-resilient-cyber"
        detail: "Demonstrated accomplishing the work of teams of people on his own by leveraging AI agents"
      - source: "T3-secappdev-2025-bio"
        detail: "Session titled 'Using AI to Write Secure React.JS Code' — applying AI within his domain"

  investment_by_domain_expertise:
    description: >
      Jim's investment decisions cluster tightly around application
      security tooling — the exact domain of his professional expertise.
      He invests in what he deeply understands.
    evidence:
      - source: "T3-secappdev-2025-bio"
        detail: "Fund-limited investor with Aviso Ventures, backing: SemGrep, EdgeScan, Nucleus Security, Defect Dojo, KSOC, Akto, MergeBase, Inspectiv, Levo.ai, Phoenix"
    pattern: >
      All investment targets are security tooling companies. No evidence
      of investments outside his core domain. This suggests domain-bound
      investment conviction rather than diversified portfolio thinking.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. SOCIAL INTERACTION PATTERNS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
social_interaction_patterns:

  audience_empathy:
    description: >
      Jim deliberately calibrates his communication to the audience level.
      He translates complex AppSec concepts for both technical and
      non-technical audiences rather than speaking at a single register.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-virtual-ciso-ep19"
        detail: "Translates complex AppSec concepts for both technical and non-technical audiences. Ensures even technically un-savvy listeners could grasp fundamentals."
      - source: "T2-podcast-virtual-ciso-ep19"
        detail: "Host noted Jim's great business sense and capacity to excite audiences about security"

  developer_advocacy:
    description: >
      Jim positions himself as an advocate FOR developers, not a security
      person lecturing AT developers. His framing consistently treats
      developers as professionals who need enablement, not correction.
    evidence:
      - source: "T3-manicode-website"
        quote: "You can and will write secure code"
        note: "Affirmative, empowering framing"
      - source: "T2-podcast-itspmagazine-brand-story"
        quote: "Developers should view security as essential software quality, not merely compliance checkbox"
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
        quote: "I want them to walk away being lifted up and excited"

  mentorship_lineage:
    description: >
      Jim explicitly credits Stephen Northcutt as the mentor who pivoted
      his career. He honors this mentorship lineage publicly and
      repeatedly, suggesting strong values around gratitude and
      intellectual debt acknowledgment.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        detail: "Transitioned to security education after mentorship by Stephen Northcutt"
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
        detail: "Pivotal moment: met Stephen Northcutt, who recognized need for security from developer perspective"

  cross_functional_bridge:
    description: >
      Jim actively bridges the gap between developer teams and security
      teams. He advocates for partnership models where developers and
      security teams collaborate, rather than adversarial gatekeeping.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-tromzo-owasp-top10"
        quote: "When developers explain app functionality and security logging together with teams, they know what logs matter most"
      - source: "T2-podcast-virtual-ciso-ep19"
        detail: "Title concept: 'AppSec is a Team Sport'"
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        detail: "Core pillar: Embedded Security Champions within dev teams"

  podcast_accessibility:
    description: >
      Jim is highly accessible to podcast hosts and media. Across the
      collected sources, he appeared on at least 5 different podcasts
      with varied hosts and audiences, suggesting he prioritizes
      visibility and knowledge dissemination through media channels.
    observed_appearances:
      - "The Secure Developer (Snyk/Heavybit)"
      - "Absolute AppSec"
      - "Resilient Cyber"
      - "The Virtual CISO Podcast"

        quote: "Significant demand for his course covering prompt injection, model poisoning, and data theft vulnerabilities in AI systems"

  triple_role_maintenance:
    description: >
      Jim simultaneously maintains three distinct professional roles:
      (1) educator/trainer, (2) OWASP volunteer leader, (3) investor/advisor.
      These are not sequential career phases but concurrent activities.
    roles:
      - "Educator: 100+ training days, course development, conference speaking"
      - "OWASP Leader: ASVS, Proactive Controls, Cheatsheet Series stewardship"
      - "Investor/Advisor: Aviso Ventures, 10+ portfolio companies"
