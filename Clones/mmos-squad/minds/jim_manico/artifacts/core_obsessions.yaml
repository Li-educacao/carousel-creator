  Obsessions are the deep, persistent questions and drives that animate a
  person beyond conscious strategy. They're what Jim keeps coming back to
  when nobody is paying him to — the topics that show up in his volunteer
  work, his investments, his tweets, and his off-script moments. These go
  deeper than professional interests; they're the engines of his cognition.

central_driving_questions:

  - id: CDQ-01
    question: "How do you make developers CARE about security, not just comply with it?"
    depth: "existential_for_his_career"
    description: >
      This is the foundational question of Jim's entire professional life.
      Not 'how do you make software secure' (that's the engineering question)
      but 'how do you make the PEOPLE who write software care enough to do it
      right?' This is an educational and motivational question, not a
      technical one, which is why his approach centers on lifting people up
      rather than scanning their code.
    manifestations:
      - "Teaching as 'half performance, half knowledge' — performance matters because engagement matters"
      - "'I want them to walk away being lifted up and excited' — emotional impact is the goal"
      - "'You can and will write secure code' — affirmative framing, not fear-based"
      - "Translates for non-technical audiences — making security accessible is key to making people care"
      - "Security as 'essential software quality, not merely compliance checkbox'"
    unresolved_aspect: >
      After 20+ years, developers STILL don't universally care about security.
      The industry still treats it as a checkbox. Jim keeps refining his
      approach (adding AI training, evolving standards) but the core question
      remains unanswered at scale.

        quote: "I want them to walk away being lifted up and excited."

        quote: "Developers should view security as essential software quality."

  - id: CDQ-02
    question: "What is the RIGHT level of security standard — comprehensive enough to be real, simple enough to be adopted?"
    depth: "core_professional_tension"
    description: >
      The tension between the OWASP Top 10 (too simple) and ASVS (200+
      requirements, potentially overwhelming) is not just a technical debate
      for Jim — it's a fundamental question about how standards should work.
      He's spent over a decade building and refining the answer.
    manifestations:
      - "Created the Maturity Ladder (Top 10 → Proactive Controls → ASVS)"
      - "Built the 'developer-centric ASVS 5 fork' to bridge the gap"
      - "Describes Proactive Controls as 'a starting point' — not the destination"
      - "Pushes organizations up the ladder without dismissing where they are"
      - "Now extending to AISVS for AI systems — same question, new domain"
    unresolved_aspect: >
      Most organizations STILL stop at the Top 10. ASVS adoption is growing
      but not universal. The question of 'right level' may not have a universal
      answer — it may require perpetual calibration.

  - id: CDQ-03
    question: "How does the threat landscape evolve, and how do you stay one step ahead in education?"
    depth: "pattern_recognition_drive"
    description: >
      Jim is constantly tracking the shifting landscape: which threats are
      declining, which are emerging, what technologies solve old problems
      and create new ones. This isn't casual monitoring — it's an obsession
      with staying current that drives his curriculum evolution.
    manifestations:
      - "Tracks SQL injection → XSS → third-party libraries → access control → AI security"
      - "Acknowledges solved problems instead of rehashing them"
      - "Created entirely new AI security course responding to market demand"
      - "Invested in companies addressing emerging threat categories"
      - "AISVS represents forward-looking standard creation"
    unresolved_aspect: >
      AI security is moving faster than any previous shift. The question of
      whether traditional standards-based approaches can keep up with AI's
      pace of change is genuinely open.
    sources:
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        quote: "Third-party library security is now the number one issue."
      - source: "T2-podcast-tromzo-owasp-top10"
        detail: "AI security training in high demand."

  - id: CDQ-04
    question: "Where do I fit in — and does it matter?"
    depth: "identity_level"
    description: >
      Jim's self-reflective tweet reveals a deep, ongoing question about
      professional identity. After 20 years, he's neither a developer nor
      a traditional security person. His 'main expertise is PowerPoint,
      research and education.' This identity ambiguity has been PRODUCTIVE
      rather than paralyzing — but it's clearly something he thinks about.
    manifestations:
      - "'After 20 years I never felt like I fit in'"
      - "'Not really a developer anymore and never a traditional security professional'"
      - "'It's been a joy carving my own path' — resolved toward acceptance"
      - "Created his own category rather than conforming to existing ones"
      - "The word 'joy' suggests this question is settled but still present"
    resolution_status: >
      Largely resolved with acceptance and even celebration. But the fact
      that he publicly shared this after 20 years suggests it's a thought
      that persists. The resolution is not 'I found where I fit' but
      'fitting in doesn't matter — carving my own path is better.'

    driver: "The Problem Keeps Evolving"
    description: >
      Just when one set of vulnerabilities gets solved, new ones emerge.
      SQL injection was solved, so he pivoted to XSS. Frameworks helped
      with XSS, so he pivoted to supply chain. Now AI creates entirely
      new attack surfaces. The problem is a moving target, which means
      the work is never done and never boring.
    evidence:
      - "Curriculum has evolved dramatically over 20 years"
      - "Created AISVS as a brand new project in response to AI evolution"
      - "New course: 'Harnessing LLMs for Application Security'"

  - id: SM-02
    driver: "The Impact is Visible and Immediate"
    description: >
      Training produces immediate feedback: students learn, apply, and
      the code gets better. Unlike many security roles where impact is
      invisible (you prevented a breach that nobody knows about), education
      has visible results. Jim can see the light bulb moment in the room.
    evidence:
      - "'I want them to walk away being lifted up and excited'"
      - "Has trained thousands of engineers globally"
      - "Example: startup that invested in security education became multi-billion-dollar company"

  - id: SM-03
    driver: "The Community Reinforcement"
    description: >
      OWASP provides a global community of peers, co-creators, and users
      of his work. Conference speaking provides energy and validation.
      The security community recognizes and celebrates his contributions
      (Java Champion, OWASP Board, JavaOne Rock Star). This social fuel
      sustains long-term effort.
    evidence:
      - "5+ conferences per year for decades"
      - "Java Champion, JavaOne Rock Star Hall of Fame"
      - "OWASP Global Board Member"
      - "Co-founded LocoMocoSec — creating community, not just participating"

  - id: SM-04
    driver: "The Joy of Independent Path"
    description: >
      There's a deep satisfaction in having built something entirely
      his own. Not working for a big company, not following a conventional
      career track, but creating a unique niche at the intersection of
      development, security, education, standards, and investment.
    evidence:
      - "'It's been a joy carving my own path'"
      - "CEO/Founder of Manicode — his own company"

    theme: "ASVS > Top 10"
    frequency: "Nearly every talk, podcast, and interview"
    description: >
      No matter what the ostensible topic is, Jim will find a way to
      redirect to 'the Top 10 is a starting point, but ASVS is the
      real standard.' This is his signature message, his brand, and
      his deepest professional conviction.

    theme: "Security is an education problem"
    frequency: "Every engagement"
    description: >
      Whether discussing AI, tools, standards, or organization design,
      Jim always returns to: the root cause is that people weren't taught.
      The solution starts with teaching.

  - id: RT-03
    theme: "Developer perspective on security"
    frequency: "Foundational to everything"
    description: >
      Jim always frames security from the builder's viewpoint, not the
      attacker's. Proactive Controls (what to DO) rather than threat
      taxonomies (what to FEAR). This developer lens is what makes his
      work distinctive and is the recurring filter through which he
      processes all security information.
    sources:
      - "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
      - "T1-owasp-proactive-controls"

  - id: RT-04
    theme: "The insufficiency of scanning tools"
    frequency: "Frequent"
    description: >
      Jim repeatedly points out that automated scanning misses the most
      important problems (access control, logic flaws). This is his
      counterargument to the 'just buy a tool' approach to security.
    sources:
      - "T2-podcast-tromzo-owasp-top10"
        quote: "Automated CI/CD scanning misses the number one OWASP problem — broken access control."

  - id: RT-05
    theme: "Comprehensive logging"
    frequency: "Regular"
    description: >
      'Log wild, baby' is a signature phrase. Jim consistently advocates
      for extensive security logging as a bridge between development and
      security operations — a theme that connects his developer background
      with runtime security needs.

    theme: "Security champions embedded in dev teams"
    frequency: "Regular"
    description: >
      The idea that AppSec experts should be INSIDE development teams,
      not in a separate security department. This is a team composition
      obsession that reflects his belief in developer empowerment.

    question: "Can AI be trusted to write secure code, or will it amplify insecurity?"
    status: "actively_exploring"
    description: >
      Jim sees AI as both massive opportunity and massive risk. He's
      developed security-centric prompting approaches and created AISVS,
      but the fundamental question of whether AI will make software MORE
      or LESS secure is genuinely open.
    his_current_position: >
      "Augmentation rather than replacement." AI is a tool that can be
      directed toward security if properly prompted and constrained.
      But the risk of developers adopting AI without security guardrails
      is real and present.
    sources:
      - "T2-podcast-resilient-cyber"
      - "T2-podcast-itspmagazine-brand-story"

  - id: UQ-02
    question: "How do you scale security education to millions of developers?"
    status: "partially_resolved"
    description: >
      Jim trains hundreds directly per year, but there are millions of
      developers worldwide. Standards (ASVS, Proactive Controls) scale
      better than training, but standards alone don't teach. AI-assisted
      training may be the answer, but it's not proven yet.
    his_current_approach: >
      Multi-channel: live training, downloadable courses, Udemy, OWASP
      free resources, conference talks, AI integration into training.
      But the scale problem persists.
    sources:
      - "T3-manicode-website"
      - "T2-podcast-resilient-cyber"

  - id: UQ-03
    question: "What happens to security education when AI writes most of the code?"
    status: "emerging"
    description: >
      If AI generates 80%+ of production code in the future, the role
      of developer security education fundamentally changes. Does Jim
      train the AI? Train the developer to review AI code? Train prompt
      engineers? This is the existential question for his career model.
    his_current_position: >
      "Teach BOTH developers AND AI systems to write secure code." But
      the full implications are still emerging. His new courses on
      'AI-enhanced secure code review' and 'Harnessing LLMs for AppSec'
      are early answers.

    confidence: "high"
    description: >
      Jim is co-leading OWASP AISVS — applying the same verification
      standard methodology that made ASVS successful to the AI domain.
      This is clearly his next major standards initiative.
    evidence:
      - "AISVS project co-leadership"
      - "New training courses on AI security"

  - id: FO-02
    direction: "Security-Centric Prompting as a Discipline"
    confidence: "medium-high"
    description: >
      Jim is pioneering the idea that HOW you prompt AI models directly
      affects the security of the code they produce. This could become
      a new sub-discipline with its own best practices, similar to how
      secure coding became a discipline for humans.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-resilient-cyber"
        detail: "Security-centric prompts reduce 'vulnerability velocity.'"
      - "Prompt libraries and enterprise controls for secure AI development"

  - id: FO-03
    direction: "The 'Developer-Centric' Revolution in Standards"
    confidence: "medium"
    description: >
      The developer-centric ASVS 5 fork signals a broader movement
      toward making security standards DEVELOPER-FRIENDLY rather than
      auditor-friendly. Jim may be heading toward a fundamental
      reconceptualization of how security standards are written and
      consumed.
    evidence:
      - "Developer-centric ASVS 5 fork"
      - "Consistent emphasis on developer experience"
      - "AI as bridge between complex standards and developer needs"

  - id: FO-04
    direction: "Legacy and Succession"
    confidence: "medium"
    description: >
      With 20+ years invested, Jim may be increasingly thinking about
      the sustainability of his work beyond his personal involvement.
      The OWASP projects have multiple co-leaders. AISVS involves
      new collaborators. The standards are designed to outlast any
      individual contributor.
    evidence:
      - "Multiple co-leaders on every OWASP project"
      - "OWASP Board governance participation"
      - "Standards designed as institutional, not personal"

# =============================================================================
# OBSESSION MAP: How the obsessions connect
# =============================================================================

obsession_map:
  description: >
    Jim's obsessions form a tight, interconnected web. The central node
    is CDQ-01 (how to make developers care about security). Everything
    else radiates from this:

    - Standards (CDQ-02) are the TOOLS for making developers care
    - Threat landscape tracking (CDQ-03) keeps the message RELEVANT
    - Identity questions (CDQ-04) explain WHY he's the one doing this
    - AI (FO-01, FO-02) is the next FRONTIER for the same mission
    - Scaling (UQ-02) is the unsolved CHALLENGE
    - Legacy (FO-04) is the long-term SUSTAINABILITY

  central_obsession: >
    If there is ONE thing that drives everything Jim Manico does, it
    is this: the belief that if developers are properly educated about
    security, they will build secure software. Everything else — the
    standards, the conferences, the investments, the OWASP work, the
    AI courses — is in service of this single, persistent, 20-year
    obsession with developer security education.
