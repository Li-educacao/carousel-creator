    value: "Developer Empowerment Through Knowledge"
    category: "professional_mission"
    description: >
      The single most consistent thread across all of Jim's work: giving
      developers the knowledge and capability to write secure code themselves.
      Not controlling them, not gatekeeping them, not scanning their code
      for them — EMPOWERING them. This is not just a professional strategy;
      it reads as a calling.
    behavioral_evidence:
      - "Founded an entire company (Manicode) dedicated to this single value"
      - "Conducts 100+ training days per year, every year, for decades"
      - "Created Proactive Controls — a framework of what developers SHOULD do, not what they shouldn't"
      - "Tagline: 'You can and will write secure code' — affirmative, empowering"
      - "Teaches AI systems to write secure code, extending empowerment beyond humans"
      - "Wants students to 'walk away being lifted up and excited'"
    what_he_sacrifices_for_this:
      - "Could earn more as a CISO or in product — stays in education"

    value: "Standards-Based Rigor"
    category: "professional_methodology"
    description: >
      Jim deeply values measurable, verifiable, comprehensive standards over
      vague guidelines or best practices. ASVS (200+ specific requirements)
      represents the embodiment of this value. He pushes organizations beyond
      awareness (Top 10) toward verification (ASVS) because he believes
      security claims must be testable.
    behavioral_evidence:
      - "Co-leads ASVS — a 200+ requirement verification standard"
      - "Created the developer-centric ASVS 5 fork to make standards MORE actionable"
      - "Requirement format: chapter.section.requirement (e.g., 1.11.3) — precise numbering"
      - "Demands precision: 'everything you say must be more precise and taken to a new level of rigor'"
      - "Extended standards methodology to AI (AISVS)"
    tension_with_other_values: >
      Sometimes in tension with simplicity and accessibility. Standards are
      inherently complex (200+ requirements), but Jim resolves this by creating
      on-ramps (Proactive Controls) and actionable forks (developer-centric ASVS 5).

      Jim has spent over two decades contributing to OWASP — an open,
      free-to-access community. He co-leads multiple projects that are
      freely available to anyone. He serves on the OWASP Global Board.
      This isn't just volunteering; it's a value system that says security
      knowledge should be a public good.
    behavioral_evidence:
      - "OWASP Global Board Member — governance-level commitment"

    value: "Practical Impact Over Theoretical Perfection"
    category: "pragmatism"
    description: >
      Jim consistently prioritizes what WORKS over what's theoretically
      ideal. His teaching methodology combines lecture with demonstrations
      and code review — not just theory. He evaluates security advice by
      whether developers will actually implement it.
    behavioral_evidence:
      - "Training methodology: lecture + security testing demonstration + code review"
      - "Developer-centric ASVS 5 fork: 'opinionated, actionable, not bureaucratic'"
      - "Translates complex concepts for non-technical audiences"

    value: "Intellectual Honesty & Evolution"
    category: "epistemic_virtue"
    description: >
      Jim is willing to say 'this is no longer the main problem' when the
      data shows it. He acknowledged SQL injection was 'largely solved.'
      He challenges the OWASP Top 10 despite being an OWASP Board member.
      He evolves his focus as the landscape changes. This intellectual
      honesty is rare in an industry where people build careers on specific
      threat categories and keep pushing them even after they decline.
    behavioral_evidence:
      - "Publicly critiques OWASP Top 10 as insufficient — despite being on the OWASP Board"
      - "Acknowledges when problems are solved by technology evolution"
      - "Redirects attention to emerging threats instead of rehashing old ones"

    description: >
      Jim chose to live on Kauai, Hawaii — one of the most remote and
      beautiful places in the world — while maintaining a global
      cybersecurity career. This is not accidental. It represents a
      deliberate choice to prioritize life quality, family, and
      environment alongside professional impact. The Hawaiian phrase
      'Kulia I Ka Nu'u' (strive for the summit) suggests he integrates
      Hawaiian philosophy into his worldview.
    behavioral_evidence:
      - "Lives on Kauai, Hawaii with wife Tracey"
      - "Co-founded LocoMocoSec — brought the security community TO Hawaii"

      Beyond education, Jim values having strategic influence in the
      AppSec industry through advisory roles and investments. His
      portfolio of 11+ security company investments and his Aviso
      Ventures fund-limited investor role show that he wants to shape
      the INDUSTRY, not just train individuals.
    behavioral_evidence:

      The free OWASP work creates the DEMAND for his paid training
      (developers learn WHAT to learn from OWASP, then hire Manicode

      education (developer-friendly tools like Semgrep), not compete
      with it. The open standards make the paid implementation viable.

    notes: "Extending core values into AI era rather than being displaced by it."

  evolution_pattern: >
    Jim's values don't REPLACE each other — they STACK. He never abandoned
    developer empowerment for standards creation, or standards for business.
    Each new layer adds to the previous ones. This is characteristic of
    someone whose core identity is stable while their expression of it evolves.

# =============================================================================
# PROFESSIONAL vs. PERSONAL VALUES
# =============================================================================

professional_vs_personal:

  professional_values:
    - "Developer empowerment through education"
    - "Standards-based rigor"

    - "Business strategy"

  personal_values:
    - "Intentional living (Hawaii choice)"
    - "Family (wife Tracey)"
    - "Hawaiian cultural values (Kulia I Ka Nu'u — strive for the summit)"
    - "Joy in carving one's own path"
    - "Independence and self-direction"

  overlap: >
    The professional and personal values are deeply integrated. His choice
    to live in Hawaii while running a global security education company
    IS the expression of both value systems simultaneously. He doesn't
    compartmentalize. The joy he expresses in 'carving my own path'
    applies equally to his unique career positioning and his life choices.
