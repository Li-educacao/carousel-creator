# 1. PROFESSIONAL ROUTINE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
professional_routine:

  training_schedule:
    volume: "100+ days per year"
    calculation: >
      100+ training days out of ~250 working days means Jim spends roughly
      40% of his professional time actively teaching. The remaining 60%
      is split across content development, OWASP work, advisory roles,
      conference preparation, and travel.
    format_mix:
      in_person: "Conference workshops, on-site corporate training"
      virtual: "Live virtual courses (e.g., 'Practical Secure Code Review - AI Enhanced')"
      downloadable: "Pre-recorded course materials via Manicode"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        detail: "100+ training days annually"
      - source: "T3-manicode-website"
        detail: "Live and downloadable courses"

  conference_circuit:
    description: >
      Jim maintains a global conference presence, appearing at both
      security-specific and developer-focused events. Based on the
      collected sources, he speaks at multiple major conferences per year
      across different continents.
    observed_2025_schedule:
      - event: "SecAppDev 2025"
        location: "Leuven, Belgium"
        dates: "June 2-6, 2025"
        sessions: 2
        detail: "90-min lecture + full-day workshop"
        source: "T3-secappdev-2025-bio"

        detail: "Training course on LLMs for AppSec"
        source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
    travel_pattern: >
      The conference circuit requires significant international travel —
      from his home in Hawaii to Europe, Las Vegas, and likely many
      other US/international destinations. This suggests a routine
      built around extended travel periods interspersed with home time.

  owasp_maintenance_cycle:
    description: >
      Jim has maintained OWASP projects continuously since 2014. This
      involves regular content reviews, version planning, community
      coordination with co-leaders, and release management. ASVS 5.0.0
      release in May 2025 represents the latest in a decade-long
      maintenance cycle.

      for AI security training, indicating he tracks demand signals
      and responds with new curriculum.

  investment_advisory_routine:
    description: >
      As a fund-limited investor with Aviso Ventures, Jim likely
      evaluates security startups regularly, attends board meetings or
      advisory calls, and leverages his conference network for deal flow.
      With 10 portfolio companies, this represents a meaningful time
      commitment alongside his primary teaching work.
    portfolio_size: 10
    vehicle: "Aviso Ventures"

      - "Advisory board participation"
      - "Network-based deal flow (conference connections)"
      - "Portfolio company mentorship"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. CONTENT CREATION PATTERNS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
content_creation_patterns:

  primary_outputs:
    description: >
      Jim's content creation centers on three main output types:
      training materials, OWASP project documentation, and public
      speaking. He does not appear to be a prolific blog writer or
      social media content creator — his content flows through
      live teaching and standards work.
    output_types:
      - type: "Training courses and workshops"
        frequency: "Continuously updated, multiple active courses"
        distribution: "Live delivery + Manicode platform"
      - type: "OWASP project documentation"
        frequency: "Major versions every 2-4 years, ongoing maintenance"
        distribution: "OWASP website, PDF/Word/CSV/JSON formats"
      - type: "Conference presentations"
        frequency: "Multiple per year across global events"
        distribution: "Live audiences + some recorded (NDC YouTube)"
      - type: "Podcast appearances"
        frequency: "Regular (5+ observed in collected sources)"
        distribution: "Various podcast platforms"

  book_authorship:
    title: "Iron-Clad Java"
    description: >
      Jim authored 'Iron-Clad Java,' a book on secure Java development.
      This represents a more traditional, long-form content creation
      effort. No evidence of subsequent books, suggesting this was a
      one-time effort rather than a regular habit.
    evidence:
      - source: "T3-secappdev-2025-bio"

  ai_augmented_content_creation:
    description: >
      Jim has begun using AI tools in his content creation and training
      development process. He described accomplishing 'the work of teams
      of people on his own' by leveraging AI agents, suggesting AI has
      become integrated into his content production routine.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-resilient-cyber"
        detail: "Completing tasks that used to take tens of hundreds of hours"
      - source: "T2-podcast-itspmagazine-brand-story"
        detail: "Integrates AI tools into training: assist with complex questions, identify knowledge gaps, refine content"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PATTERNS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
community_engagement_patterns:

  owasp_volunteering:
    description: >
      Jim's OWASP involvement is not casual volunteering — it is a
      central pillar of his professional identity. He has led projects
      for over a decade, maintains active co-leadership roles, and his
      company (Manicode) is listed as a 'Maintaining Supporter' of ASVS.
    depth: "Deep — project leadership, not just contribution"
    duration: "11+ years (2014-2025+)"
    financial_support: "Manicode as Maintaining Supporter"
    evidence:
      - source: "T1-owasp-asvs"
        detail: "Manicode is a Maintaining Supporter"
      - source: "T1-owasp-proactive-controls"
        detail: "Created v1.0 in 2014, still active"

  conference_community:
    description: >
      Jim is a fixture in the AppSec conference community. His
      relationships with conference organizers, podcast hosts, and
      fellow speakers suggest deep social capital in this ecosystem.
    indicators:
      - "Regular podcast guest across multiple shows"
      - "Invited speaker/trainer at premier events (DEF CON, NDC, SecAppDev, Global AppSec)"
      - "Known by first name in the community"

  developer_community_bridge:
    description: >
      Jim intentionally engages with developer communities (not just
      security communities). His presence at NDC (a developer conference)
      and his focus on React/framework-specific security training
      demonstrate deliberate outreach beyond the security bubble.
    evidence:
      - source: "T1-ndc-owasp-top10-to-asvs"
        detail: "Speaking at NDC — a developer conference, not a security conference"
      - source: "T3-secappdev-2025-bio"
        detail: "AI + React.JS secure coding — meeting developers where they work"

    label: "Security Immersion Phase"
    description: >
      Pivotal transition triggered by Stephen Northcutt mentorship.
      Intensive immersion at SANS (100-hour work weeks), deep AppSec
      study, and the shift from practitioner to educator.
    key_events:
      - "Met Stephen Northcutt — career-changing mentorship"
      - "SANS: 100-hour work weeks, deep AppSec immersion"
      - "Aspect Security: software development under NDA"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"

  phase_3:
    period: "~2012 - ~2016"
    label: "Industry Role Phase"
    description: >
      Moved through industry positions — WhiteHat Security acquired his
      static analysis startup, took evangelist role. During this period,
      also launched OWASP leadership (ASVS v2 in 2014, Proactive
      Controls v1.0 in 2014).
    key_events:
      - "WhiteHat Security: acquired his static analysis startup"
      - "OWASP ASVS v2 (2014) — Lead Author"
      - "OWASP Proactive Controls v1.0 (2014) — Co-author"
      - "Published Iron-Clad Java"

  phase_4:
    period: "~2016 - ~2023"
    label: "Independent Educator Phase"
    description: >
      Founded Manicode Security. Established independent training
      practice with 100+ day annual schedule. Continued OWASP
      leadership. Began investment activity with Aviso Ventures.
    key_events:
      - "Founded Manicode Security"
      - "Established 100+ training days/year routine"
      - "Java Champion designation"
      - "Investment portfolio building (10 companies)"
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"
      - source: "T3-secappdev-2025-bio"

  phase_5:
    period: "~2023 - present"
    label: "AI Integration Phase"
    description: >
      Jim has rapidly integrated AI into his practice — both as a topic
      he teaches (AI security, prompt injection, LLM security) and as
      a tool he uses (AI-enhanced code review, AI-augmented content
      creation). This represents the current evolutionary edge.
    key_events:
      - "Launched AI security training courses"
      - "Integrated AI into personal productivity (teams of people on his own)"
      - "ASVS 5.0.0 release (May 2025)"
      - "AI-enhanced secure coding workshops"

      - source: "T3-secappdev-2025-bio"
      - source: "T2-podcast-itspmagazine-brand-story"

  evolution_pattern: >
    Jim's career follows a clear trajectory: build deep technical
    skills -> get mentored into security -> immerse intensively ->
    work in industry -> go independent -> scale through teaching ->
    integrate AI. Each phase builds on the previous, and he never
    abandons earlier commitments (still teaching, still maintaining
    OWASP projects, still investing). Accumulative, not sequential.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 6. INFERRED WEEKLY ROUTINE (APPROXIMATE)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
inferred_weekly_routine:
  note: >
    This is an approximation based on the 100+ training days,
    conference schedule, OWASP responsibilities, and investment
    activities. Actual routine varies by week.

  training_weeks:
    description: >
      During training weeks (~20-25 weeks per year if averaging 4-5
      training days per week), Jim's routine is dominated by live
