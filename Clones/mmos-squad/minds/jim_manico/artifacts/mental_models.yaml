  # MODEL 1: The Education-First Security Model
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - id: MM-01
    name: "Education-First Security"
    category: "foundational_worldview"
    description: >
      Jim's central mental model is that insecurity is fundamentally an
      education problem, not a tooling problem. The root cause of vulnerable
      software is developers who were never taught to write secure code.
      Therefore, the highest-leverage intervention is training developers,
      not buying more scanning tools or hiring more pentesters.
    core_proposition: >
      "The primary cause of insecurity is the absence of secure software
      development practices."
    how_it_manifests:
      - "Conducts 100+ training days annually — this is his primary professional activity"
      - "Founded Manicode Security as an education company, not a product company"
      - "Prioritizes 'trained workforce' as the FIRST pillar of AppSec implementation"
      - "Teaches both developers AND AI systems to write secure code"
      - "Views AI as an educational force multiplier, not a replacement for understanding"
    implications:
      - "Tools are secondary to human knowledge"
      - "Security champions embedded in dev teams > external security teams"
      - "Investment in developer training has higher ROI than investment in scanners"

  # MODEL 2: The Maturity Ladder (Top 10 → ASVS)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - id: MM-02
    name: "The Maturity Ladder"
    category: "framework_hierarchy"
    description: >
      Jim organizes the security landscape as a maturity progression. The
      OWASP Top 10 is merely an awareness document — a starting point that
      organizations should NOT treat as a comprehensive standard. The real
      standard is ASVS (200+ verification requirements). Organizations that
      stop at the Top 10 have only completed step one of a multi-step journey.
    core_proposition: >
      "OWASP Top 10 = awareness tool (starting point). OWASP ASVS =
      verification standard (comprehensive security). Organizations should
      USE ASVS for real security, not just reference Top 10."

  # MODEL 3: The Four Pillars of AppSec Programs
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - id: MM-03
    name: "Four Pillars of AppSec Implementation"
    category: "strategic_framework"
    description: >
      Jim's structured approach to building application security programs
      within organizations. Four interdependent pillars that must all be
      present for effective security. This is his consulting mental model
      for assessing and advising organizations.
    pillars:
      - number: 1
        name: "Trained Workforce"
        description: "Developers with foundational secure coding knowledge"
        priority: "Highest — must come first"
      - number: 2
        name: "Security Requirements"
        description: "Based on OWASP ASVS, not just Top 10"

        description: "AppSec experts integrated within development teams"
        priority: "High — bridges security and development"

        name: "Assessment Infrastructure"
        description: "SAST, DAST, third-party library analysis"
        priority: "Important — but last, not first"
    key_insight: >
      Note the ordering: people and knowledge come BEFORE tools and scanning.
      This is deliberate and reflects his Education-First model. Most
      organizations start with Pillar 4 (buying tools) and skip Pillars 1-3.

  # MODEL 4: The Shifting Threat Landscape Model
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - id: MM-04
    name: "Shifting Threat Landscape"
    category: "pattern_recognition"
    description: >
      Jim tracks the evolution of attack vectors over time and adjusts his
      teaching and advocacy accordingly. He recognizes when problems are
      'solved' by technology evolution and redirects attention to the NEW
      primary threats. This is a dynamic, evidence-based mental model.
    trajectory:
      - era: "2000s"
        primary_threat: "SQL Injection"
        status: "Largely solved by ORMs and parameterized queries"
      - era: "2010s"
        primary_threat: "XSS"
        status: "Partially solved by auto-escaping frameworks (React, CSP), but persists in SPAs"
      - era: "Late 2010s"
        primary_threat: "Third-party library vulnerabilities"
        status: "Now the #1 issue, surpassing traditional injection attacks"
      - era: "2020s"
        primary_threat: "Broken access control"
        status: "The #1 OWASP problem that automated scanning CANNOT catch"
      - era: "2025+"
        primary_threat: "AI security (prompt injection, model poisoning, data theft)"
        status: "Emerging — new AISVS standard being developed"
    key_insight: >
      Each era's primary threat requires a DIFFERENT type of intervention.
      SQL injection was solved by framework defaults. XSS requires CSP +
      DOMPurify + framework discipline. Access control requires human review.
      AI security requires entirely new standards. This is why tools alone
      can never be sufficient — the landscape keeps shifting.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-secure-developer-ep26"
        quote: "Third-party library security is now the number one issue, more important than SQL injection."
      - source: "T2-podcast-absolute-appsec-ep27"

  # MODEL 5: AI as Force Multiplier (Not Replacement)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - id: MM-05
    name: "AI as Force Multiplier"
    category: "technology_philosophy"
    description: >
      Jim views AI not as a threat to developers or security professionals,
      but as a force multiplier that amplifies human capability. He has
      personally demonstrated this by accomplishing 'the work of teams'
      using AI agents. Crucially, he sees BOTH the opportunity (secure AI
      coding) AND the risk (insecure AI adoption) simultaneously.
    dual_perspective:
      opportunity:
        - "Security-centric prompting reduces vulnerability velocity"
        - "Prompt libraries and enterprise controls enable systemic secure development"
        - "AI can identify knowledge gaps and refine training content"
        - "Individuals can accomplish work of entire teams"
      risk:
        - "Developers adopting AI without security measures"
        - "Prompt injection, model poisoning, data theft as new vulnerability classes"
        - "Need for upskilling to remain employable"
    resolution: >
      The resolution is education. Just as developers needed to learn secure
      coding, they now need to learn secure AI usage. The Manicode approach
      adapts: teach BOTH developers AND AI systems to write secure code.
    evidence:
      - source: "T2-podcast-resilient-cyber"
        quote: "Accomplished 'the work of teams of people on his own' by leveraging AI agents."

  # MODEL 6: Pre-Sprint Security Infrastructure
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - id: MM-06
    name: "Pre-Sprint Security Infrastructure"
    category: "process_framework"
    description: >
      Before agile teams begin high-velocity sprinting, they must establish
      security infrastructure as a foundational discipline. Authentication
      services, access control frameworks, and cryptographic standards should
      be SETTLED before feature work begins. Security is not a feature to be
      sprinted on — it's the foundation the sprint runs on.
    principle: >
      "Pre-sprint infrastructure discipline: established authentication
      services, access control frameworks, and cryptographic standards
      BEFORE high-velocity sprinting begins."
    how_it_manifests:
      - "Treats security as pre-requisite, not post-requisite"

  # MODEL 7: Senior Developer Premium
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - id: MM-07
    name: "Senior Developer Premium"
    category: "team_composition"
    description: >
      For security-critical projects, Jim strongly favors a small number of
      highly experienced developers over a large number of juniors. Junior
      developers impose hidden costs through knowledge gaps that security
      training alone cannot fully address. This is a counterintuitive model
      in an industry that often measures productivity by headcount.
    core_proposition: >
      "I'd rather have two very senior developers than 20 novices."
    implication: >
      Security expertise compounds with experience. A senior developer who
      has internalized secure coding patterns is exponentially more valuable
      than a junior who needs constant guidance and review. The 10x developer
      is real in security — and the cost of a security mistake from a junior
      far exceeds the cost savings of their lower salary.

reasoning_patterns:

  - id: RP-01
    name: "Historical Trajectory Argument"
    description: >
      Jim frequently builds arguments by showing the historical evolution of
      a problem. He traces from the past state through the present to project
      the future. This makes his arguments compelling because they show
      pattern, not just opinion.
    example: >
      "SQL injection was the #1 problem. ORMs solved it. Then XSS. Frameworks
      partially solved it. Now it's third-party libraries and access control.
      Next it will be AI security."

  - id: RP-02
    name: "The Insufficiency Argument"
    description: >
      Jim frequently argues that something widely accepted is NECESSARY but
      INSUFFICIENT. He rarely says something is wrong — he says it's not
      enough. This is diplomatically effective and epistemically honest.
    pattern: "X is good as a starting point, but you need Y for real security."
    examples:
      - "Top 10 is necessary (awareness) but ASVS is required (verification)"
      - "Proactive Controls is a starting point, supplement with ASVS and SAMM"
      - "Scanning tools are important but won't catch access control issues"

  - id: RP-03
    name: "The Developer Empathy Argument"
    description: >
      When proposing security measures, Jim ALWAYS frames them from the
      developer's perspective. He asks 'will developers actually do this?'
      before 'is this technically correct?' This is what separates him from
      traditional security professionals who focus on what's theoretically
      best rather than what's practically adoptable.

# META-MODEL: HOW HIS MODELS INTERACT

meta_model:
  description: >
    Jim's mental models form a coherent, reinforcing system. The Education-First
    model provides the WHY (insecurity = ignorance). The Maturity Ladder provides
    the WHAT (Top 10 → Proactive Controls → ASVS → Cheatsheets). The Four Pillars
    provide the HOW (people → standards → champions → tools). The Shifting Threat
    Landscape provides the WHEN (redirect attention as threats evolve). AI as Force
    Multiplier provides the FUTURE (amplify all of the above).

  system_coherence: >
    This is not a collection of disparate ideas — it's an integrated worldview
    where each model reinforces the others. The Education-First model makes
    the Maturity Ladder necessary (people need to climb it). The Four Pillars
    operationalize the climb. The Shifting Landscape keeps the content fresh.
    The AI model extends everything into the next era.

  unique_synthesis: >
    What makes Jim's mental model system distinctive is the DEVELOPER perspective
    embedded in SECURITY frameworks. Most security thinkers build models from
    the attacker's perspective (threat modeling). Jim builds from the BUILDER's
    perspective (what should developers know and do?). This is why he created
    Proactive Controls (defensive actions) rather than another threat taxonomy.
