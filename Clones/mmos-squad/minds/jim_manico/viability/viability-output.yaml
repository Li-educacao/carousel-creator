  decision: "AUTO-APPROVE"
  rationale: "Jim Manico scores 87/100 — well above the 75-point auto-approve threshold. Exceptional expertise depth (19/20), perfect temporal relevance (15/15), and outstanding value density (14/15). The only moderate area is X-factor storytelling (3/5), as Jim is more of a practical educator than a dramatic storyteller — but this actually FITS his domain perfectly."

  strengths:
    - "Unparalleled expertise depth: 20+ years, OWASP Board, co-lead of 4 major standards"
    - "Perfect temporal relevance: AI security (AISVS) is the hottest emerging domain"
    - "Maximum actionability: frameworks, standards, and training designed for developers"
    - "Active and prolific: scheduled for 5+ conferences in 2025-2026"

  weaknesses:
    - "No dedicated Wikipedia page (reduces discoverability for non-technical audiences)"
    - "Communication style is practical/educational rather than charismatic/storytelling"
    - "Only 1 primary-author book (though quality is high)"
