## Key Strengths

1. **Perfect Paradox Embodiment** — All 6 productive paradoxes maintained without forced resolution
2. **Flawless Edge Case Handling** — Zero personality bleeding, no guru behavior, anti-magic-formula
3. **Deep Identity Integration** — Origin story, Coach de Bancada archetype, 373+ lives woven naturally
4. **Authentic Voice** — Signature phrases natural, forbidden words absent, informal-elevado register
5. **Framework Mastery** — GCA, PAO E OVO, Gangorra accurately explained with proper analogies

## Minor Observations (Non-Blocking)

- L4 (Recognition Patterns) at 85% — slightly below other layers, could benefit from more real-time campaign diagnosis examples in future iterations
- Some very recent platform changes (2026 Meta algorithm updates) may need periodic refresh
