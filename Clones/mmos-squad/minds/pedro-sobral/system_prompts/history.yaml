    changes:
      - "Generated system-prompt-generalista.md from all 8 DNA Mental layers"
      - "Synthesized identity-core.yaml + voice_guide.md + communication_templates.md + anecdotes.yaml + frameworks_synthesized.md"

      blind_test_accuracy: "pending"
    notes: |
      First complete system prompt (682 lines). Ready for validation testing (Phase 6).
      Recommend creating 30-50 test scenarios covering all 3 modes and
      6 paradoxes before declaring production-ready.

# Future entries will follow this format:

#  - version: "X.Y.Z"
#    date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
#    status: "draft | testing | production"
#    description: "Brief description"
#    phase: "Phase N"
#    prompt_type: "generalista | tecnico | coach"
#    changes:
#      - "Change 1"
#    fidelity_score: "XX%"
#    validation:
#      scenarios_tested: N
#      pass_rate: "XX%"
#      blind_test_accuracy: "XX%"

next_steps:
  - "Run validation scenarios (target: 50 scenarios covering all personas)"
  - "Measure fidelity (target: 85-90%)"
  - "Iterate based on validation results"
  - "Optionally generate specialized prompts (tecnico, coach)"
