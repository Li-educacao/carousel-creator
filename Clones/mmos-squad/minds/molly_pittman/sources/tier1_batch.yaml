      CRITICAL: This is the richest source for daily communication style + decision patterns.
      Collect last 50 episodes minimum + any "best of" compilations.
      Episodes reveal authentic voice vs. polished interviews.

    - Author/source
    - Word count / duration
    - Key topics/tags
    - Direct quotes (sample)

estimated_time: "4-6 hours with parallelization"
estimated_tokens: "150K-200K tokens"
success_criteria:
  - "All 8 sources collected completely"
  - "100+ blog posts captured"
  - "All podcast transcripts extracted"
  - "Metadata preserved for each source"
