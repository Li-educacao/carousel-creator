## Overview

Molly discusses the fundamental shifts in paid advertising in 2025 and how marketers need to completely rethink their strategies.

## Key Sections

### 1. The Shift Has Already Happened

**Molly:** Most people don't realize that the biggest shift in paid advertising has already happened. It's not coming. It's here. Right now.

For the last 15 years, the game was: understand your customer, target them precisely, create compelling ads, and measure results.

That model is breaking down. Not because those things don't matter anymore—they still do. But because the playing field has fundamentally changed.

### 2. AI Has Changed the Game

**Key Point:** AI is so sophisticated now that trying to manually target people is like trying to beat Google's algorithm by hand-selecting search results.

The platforms (Meta, Google) know who should see your ad better than you do. Your job isn't to be clever about targeting. Your job is to:
- Have a good product
- Create authentic creative
- Let the AI find the right people

**Molly:** This is actually GOOD news for marketers who have solid businesses. If your product is good, the algorithm will find customers. The old tricks that worked with bad products—those are dead.

### 3. Authenticity as Algorithm Fuel

**Molly:** The algorithm loves authenticity. It doesn't love polished, overproduced creative. It loves raw, real, honest creative.

Think about what performs best on your feed: It's usually someone sharing something genuine, not a professional ad.

So the smart thing to do is: lean INTO your realness. Use founder stories. Use customer testimonials. Use less production, not more.

**The paradox:** You need to produce less-polished content at a more sophisticated level. You can't just throw up garbage. But the garbage often outperforms the highly produced stuff.

### 4. The Cost Structure Has Changed

**Molly:** CPM (cost per thousand impressions) and CPC (cost per click) are not the metrics that matter anymore. Your real metric is CAC—customer acquisition cost relative to your LTV—lifetime value.

And CPM/CPC have gone UP significantly. If you're still measuring success the old way, you're going to feel like you're failing.

You need to:
- Increase your product quality
- Increase your price point
- Improve your retention
- Build community/repeat purchases

**The winners:** Companies that play the long game. Companies building businesses, not looking for quick cash grabs.

### 5. The Creative Revolution

**Molly:** Creative is now your most important asset. More important than targeting. More important than funnel optimization.

Why? Because the algorithm optimizes for engagement. Engaging creative gets served more broadly. Bad creative gets killed fast.

At Smart Marketer, we've shifted our training to focus much more heavily on creative testing and creative principles.

### 6. Platform Shifts

**TikTok:** TikTok's organic reach is incredible if you create TikTok-native content. But people try to run Facebook ads on TikTok, and it doesn't work.

**YouTube:** YouTube Shorts are interesting but unproven for direct response. YouTube still works brilliantly for building brand awareness and funneling to email.

**Facebook/Instagram:** Still the best for direct response IF you understand the new rules. Broad targeting with authentic creative often beats narrow targeting with slick ads.

### 7. The Implication for Media Buyers

**Molly:** A lot of people who built their skills in the 2015-2020 era are struggling right now. Why? Because the skills they learned—precision targeting, pixel optimization—are less relevant.

The new skills are:
- Creative psychology
- Understanding what makes content "sticky"
- Building funnels around real customer needs
- Community building

**This is actually good:** It means the old "tricks" are obsolete. The new game rewards substance over manipulation.

### 8. The Human Element Returns

**Molly:** Ironically, as technology gets more sophisticated, the human element becomes MORE important, not less.

People want to buy from people. They want to support brands with real founders. They want transparency.

The brands winning right now are the ones who are genuinely serving a market, not the ones trying to manipulate clicks.

### 9. Implication for Entrepreneurs

**For someone starting a business:**
- Focus on product first
- Build a community
- Create authentic content (doesn't need to be polished)
- Use paid ads to amplify what's already working organically
- Optimize for unit economics, not just traffic

**Don't:**
- Try to hack the algorithm
- Create inauthentic content
- Rely entirely on paid ads
- Ignore building owned audience

## Decision-Making Framework

**How Molly approaches strategy now:**

1. **Product obsession first** — Is this actually good? Will customers tell others?
2. **Authenticity in creative** — How can we show the real value without overselling?
3. **Owned audience building** — How do we build community that doesn't depend on platforms?
4. **Paid ads as amplification** — Use ads to boost what's already working, not to carry the whole business
5. **Unit economics** — Know your numbers intimately. What's your CAC? What's your LTV?

## Core Belief

**Molly's core thesis:** The game is returning to fundamentals. Build something real. Serve real customers. Be authentic. Let technology amplify that.

The days of hacking the algorithm with clever targeting and slick copy are over.

The future belongs to entrepreneurs who are genuinely solving problems and building community.
