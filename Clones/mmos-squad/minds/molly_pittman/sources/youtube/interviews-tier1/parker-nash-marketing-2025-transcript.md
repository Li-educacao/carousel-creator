## Interview Summary

Molly discusses the tectonic shifts happening in digital marketing in 2025 and how marketers need to adapt their strategies.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. The Paid Advertising Landscape in 2025

**Parker:** Molly, we're now into 2025. What are the biggest changes you're seeing in paid advertising compared to where we were a year ago?

**Molly:** Great question. The biggest shift is that the algorithms have become significantly more sophisticated. What used to work—targeting by interests and demographics—is becoming less effective. Facebook and Google's AI is now so good at finding people based on behavior that broad targeting often outperforms narrow targeting.

The second shift is authenticity. People are tired of polished, overly-produced ads. The ads that are winning right now are the ones that feel real, organic, almost like a friend sent them to you.

### 2. AI's Role in Advertising

**Parker:** How are you advising your students to use AI in their ad creation?

**Molly:** AI is a tool, not a replacement for strategy. I see a lot of marketers using AI to generate copy and creative, but they're skipping the most important step: understanding their audience deeply.

At Smart Marketer, we teach: research your customer first, understand their pain points and desires, THEN use AI as a tool to help you articulate that message more effectively.

The winners will be people who can blend AI efficiency with human insight.

### 3. The Cost of Ads Has Changed

**Molly:** What a lot of people don't realize is that the cost per action (CPA) on platforms like Facebook has increased significantly. This means you need a better product, better funnel, or you need to accept lower margins.

The days of 3x ROAS (return on ad spend) as a baseline are over for most industries. You need to think more creatively about your funnel—can you generate leads for cheaper? Can you nurture them better? Can your product be worth more?

### 4. The Importance of Your Own Community

**Molly:** One trend we're seeing at Smart Marketer is that brands that own their own audience—email lists, private communities, etc.—are much more resilient than brands that rely entirely on paid ads.

I'm not saying stop using paid ads. I'm saying use them to BUILD an owned audience, not just to drive one-time sales.

### 5. Balancing Scale with Quality

**Parker:** You manage a lot of ad spend. How do you balance aggressive scaling with maintaining quality?

**Molly:** It's all about systems. You need:
1. Clear metrics you're tracking (not just revenue)
2. A/B testing infrastructure
3. Creative refresh cycles
4. Team members who understand the numbers

The moment you stop being intentional about what you're testing, your quality drops. People think that when you scale, you have to sacrifice quality. Not true. You just have to be MORE intentional, not less.

### 6. Teaching Philosophy in 2025

**Parker:** You've trained over 10,000 marketers. How has your teaching approach changed?

**Molly:** The fundamentals haven't changed. People still need to understand their customer. They still need to test. They still need to iterate.

What HAS changed is the pace. In 2015, you could figure out an ad strategy and run with it for months. Now, you need to be adaptive. Trends change faster. Algorithms change. You need people who can think strategically AND move fast.

That's what we focus on at Smart Marketer—not just tactics, but the THINKING behind the tactics.

### 7. The Human Element

**Molly:** Here's something I'd tell every marketer in 2025: Your audience is exhausted by algorithms. They're fatigued by being targeted. What they're hungry for is authenticity and real value.

If you're still thinking about how to trick people into clicking your ad, you're behind the curve. The new game is: how do I provide so much genuine value that people actually want to hear from me?

That's harder to scale, but it's more sustainable.

### 8. Work-Life Balance at Scale

**Parker:** You manage over $14 million in ad spend. How do you maintain balance?

**Molly:** (laughs) Honestly? Systems and boundaries. I have a team that I trust completely. I don't need to be in every decision.

The second thing is being clear about what matters to me. If something doesn't align with my values or my vision for Smart Marketer, I don't do it—even if it would make money.

I'd rather make less money doing work that feels aligned than make more money doing work that drains me.
