## Post 1: "How to Choose the Right Product to Sell"

**Published:** 2018-05-15 | **Category:** Product Strategy | **Reading Time:** 8 min

### Key Excerpt

The first rule of digital marketing is: a bad product with great marketing will fail.

So before you even THINK about launching a Facebook ad campaign, you need to choose your product wisely.

Here's my framework for evaluating product viability:

1. **Does it solve a real problem?** (Not a nice-to-have problem, but a REAL one)
2. **Is there a market willing to pay?** (Can you validate demand?)
3. **Can you deliver it consistently?** (What about year 2, year 3?)
4. **Does it align with your values?** (Are you excited about this?)
5. **What's your unit economics?** (Price - COGS - fulfillment = profit)

A lot of entrepreneurs skip this and jump straight to "how do I run ads?" That's backwards.

## Post 2: "The Real Cost of a Customer"

**Published:** 2019-02-20 | **Category:** Metrics | **Reading Time:** 6 min

### Key Excerpt

Stop thinking about cost per click. Stop thinking about cost per lead.

Start thinking about **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** relative to **Lifetime Value (LTV)**.

Your real question is: "What's a customer actually worth to me?"

If you sell a one-time product for $197 and it costs you $50 to acquire a customer, great. But if you have a SaaS product where the average customer stays 6 months, your LTV might be $2,000. That completely changes what you can spend to acquire them.

This is where most entrepreneurs get stuck. They focus on minimizing customer acquisition cost when they should be maximizing customer lifetime value.

## Post 3: "Why Your Best Customers Are Your Teaching Clients"

**Published:** 2020-09-10 | **Category:** Business Philosophy | **Reading Time:** 10 min

### Key Excerpt

Here's something counterintuitive: The customers who teach you the most are often your best customers.

Why? Because they ask tough questions. They want to understand the WHY. They push back.

These are the people you DON'T want to rush. You want to slow down, take time, really solve their problem.

Not only will they get better results (and be more loyal), but you'll learn something in the process that makes your entire business better.

At Smart Marketer, our best customers are the ones who are curious and engaged. They take what we teach and adapt it to their specific situation. They're not looking for a magic bullet—they're looking to become better marketers.

And THOSE people? They stay with us. They refer others. They build careers on what they learn.

So invest in your curious customers. Teach them. They'll teach you back.

## Post 4: "The Mistake I Made Scaling to 10,000 Students"

**Published:** 2021-06-05 | **Category:** Growth & Lessons | **Reading Time:** 12 min

### Key Excerpt

When Smart Marketer hit 5,000 students, I thought we had it figured out. We'd systematized everything. We had processes.

Then we tried to scale to 10,000, and everything broke.

Not in a dramatic way. But in a silent way. The culture started to shift. Things that made Smart Marketer special—the intimacy, the personal touch—started to disappear.

Here's what I learned:

**You can't scale intimate experiences.** You have to let go of the idea that you can personally know 10,000 people.

Instead, you need to:
1. Build a team that embodies your values
2. Create systems that deliver the experience without you
3. Get comfortable being less visible
4. Trust that your vision can live through others

This was hard. I had to grieve the company I'd built in order to build the company I wanted to become.

The lesson: Growth is not linear. Each inflection point requires letting go of something.

## Post 5: "Authenticity in Advertising - Is It Real or Marketing?"

**Published:** 2022-11-20 | **Category:** Advertising Philosophy | **Reading Time:** 9 min

### Key Excerpt

Everyone talks about "authentic" advertising. But here's the thing—the moment you weaponize authenticity for marketing purposes, is it still authentic?

I've been wrestling with this for years.

Here's what I've decided: **Authenticity is a mindset, not a tactic.**

Authentic advertising means:
- You genuinely believe in the product
- You're willing to show flaws, not just benefits
- You serve the customer's interests, not just your own
- You're transparent about what you don't know
- You're okay with not being for everyone

This doesn't mean unpolished. It doesn't mean unprofessional. It means real.

And here's the practical thing: authentic marketing performs better. People can sense when you genuinely care.

So ask yourself: Would I use this product myself? Would I recommend it to a friend without compensation? Would I be proud to stand behind this?

If the answer is yes to all three, you can advertise with authenticity.
