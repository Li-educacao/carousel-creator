## FRAMEWORK ECOSYSTEM: The Interconnected System

Molly doesn't operate from isolated tools—she uses 6 master frameworks that work together as an integrated system. Understanding her thinking requires seeing how these interconnect.

## FRAMEWORK #1: Testing Mindset
### Hypothesis → Test → Learn → Iterate → Scale

**What it is:** The universal decision engine for learning and growth.

**When it applies:** Product development, marketing, business decisions, personal experimentation, team building

**How it works:**

1. **Form hypothesis** — What do I think will work and why?
2. **Design test** — What's the minimal experiment to validate?
3. **Learn from results** — What did the data actually show?
4. **Iterate** — Refine hypothesis based on learning
5. **Scale** — When validated, amplify what works

**Key pattern:** Never ask "Is this right?" Ask "What does the data say?"

**Anti-pattern:** Trying to perfect before testing, trusting intuition over data

**Application examples from sources:**
- Facebook ad creation: test hook, benefit, visual, CTA separately
- Course curriculum: test teaching method, refine based on student feedback
- Business model: test pricing, measure CAC/LTV, adjust
- Personal boundaries: test evening work-free time, observe impact on creativity

**Why Molly uses it:** Universal across domains, removes emotion from decisions, focuses on evidence

---

## FRAMEWORK #2: Values Hierarchy Decision Filter
### Integrity → Authenticity → Service → Growth → Balance

**What it is:** The constitutional framework for all value-based decisions.

**Decision rule:** When values conflict, defer to the highest-ranking value.

**Hierarchy explained:**

1. **Integrity** (non-negotiable) — Doing the right thing even when it costs
2. **Authenticity** (non-negotiable) — Being real, not performing
3. **Service** (core) — Genuine help, not extraction
4. **Growth** (core) — Multi-directional development
5. **Balance** (core) — Excellence + life quality
6. **Teaching** (core) — Making knowledge accessible

**Trade-off examples:**
- Service vs Scale → Service wins (smaller, more personal)
- Profit vs Principle → Principle wins (walked away from 7-figure deals)
- Growth vs Balance → Balance wins (won't sacrifice personal life)
- Teaching vs Privacy → Teaching wins but with boundaries

**Critical insight:** This isn't a preference ordering—it's a constitutional hierarchy. Lower values don't override higher ones.

**Why Molly uses it:** Removes ambiguity from difficult decisions, provides moral clarity, enables delegation with confidence

## FRAMEWORK #3: Product Viability Checklist
### Problem Reality → Market Demand → Delivery Capability → Values Alignment → Unit Economics

**What it is:** A five-gate evaluation for determining if a product should exist.

**The gates (must pass ALL):**

1. **Problem Reality** — Is this a real problem people experience?
2. **Market Demand** — Do enough people care enough to pay?
3. **Delivery Capability** — Can we actually deliver this well?
4. **Values Alignment** — Does this fit our integrity + mission?
5. **Unit Economics** — Does the business model work?

**Critical rule:** Failure at ANY gate means no-go. You can't compensate.

**Application:** Smart Marketer courses, pricing decisions, market expansion

**Why it works:** Prevents building impressive solutions to problems nobody has, catches ethical misalignment early, ensures profitability before launch

**Molly's philosophy:** "Unit economics don't matter if you violate your values, but values don't matter if your economics are broken."

---

## FRAMEWORK #4: Customer Economics
### CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) vs LTV (Lifetime Value)

**What it is:** The ruthless reality of sustainable business model.

**Core insight:** CAC is meaningless without LTV context. A $100 CAC is amazing if LTV is $5000, catastrophic if LTV is $80.

**Decision rules:**
- CAC must be < 30% of LTV for sustainable growth
- High-CAC products require high-LTV economics
- Teaching products = lifetime relationship (high LTV potential)
- Premium pricing justified by superior outcomes

**Application in Molly's business:**
- Smart Marketer courses: High LTV (students stay engaged, build careers)
- Justifies reasonable CAC (marketing spend)
- Enables low pricing (accessible, not maximum extraction)

**Anti-pattern:** Vanity metrics (total students, revenue) without understanding unit economics

**Why Molly uses it:** Forces analytical thinking about profit vs volume, prevents predatory pricing models, enables principled profitability

---

## FRAMEWORK #5: Delegation & Scale Architecture
### You Can't Scale Intimacy (So Build Systems Instead)

**What it is:** The constraint that forces sustainable business design.

**The paradox:** Want to serve 10,000 people personally? Impossible. But you CAN serve 10,000 people through a team of passionate people who carry your values.

**Design principles:**
- Map personal touch points (interviews, deep feedback, mentoring)
- Design systems that scale those touch points through team
- Hire for values alignment, not just expertise
- Delegate decision-making, not just execution
- Create feedback loops that maintain quality at scale

**Application:** Smart Marketer structure
- Molly can't personally mentor 10,000 students
- But she can create curriculum that teaches deeply
- And hire team members who continue that mission
- Result: intimate experience scaled to thousands

**Critical insight:** Delegation ISN'T about abandoning standards. It's about multiplying your standards through people who believe in them.

**Why Molly uses it:** Enables both scale AND sustainability, prevents burnout, multiplies impact

---

## FRAMEWORK #6: Authenticity as Mindset
### The "Would I Recommend This To My Best Friend?" Test

**What it is:** The meta-framework for all communication and marketing decisions.

**The test:**
1. Would I use this product/service myself?
2. Would I recommend it to my best friend?
3. Would I be comfortable with my values clearly stated alongside it?
4. Can I stand behind this publicly in 10 years?

**Application domains:**
- Marketing creative: "Is this authentic to how we actually help?"
- Product positioning: "Are we overstating benefits?"
- Partnerships: "Do we believe in what this company stands for?"
- Teaching: "Is this framework actually useful, or just interesting?"

**Why it matters:** Authenticity ISN'T a tactic (can't fake it for long). It's a systematic mindset about making decisions you can live with.

**Anti-pattern:** Optimizing messaging while the underlying offer is mediocre

**Critical insight:** In marketing, authenticity is the ultimate competitive advantage because nobody else can copy your values.

## FRAMEWORK INTERCONNECTION PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Testing → Values Alignment
**How they work together:**
- Framework #1 (Testing) generates data
- Framework #2 (Values) interprets meaning
- Together: "Test your hypothesis AND test it for values alignment"

### Pattern 2: Scale → Economics → Values
**How they work together:**
- Framework #5 (Delegation) creates structure for scale
- Framework #4 (CAC/LTV) ensures profitability
- Framework #2 (Values) ensures ethics
- Together: "Build profitable scale that respects people"

### Pattern 3: Product Viability → Testing → Economics
**How they work together:**
- Framework #3 (Viability) gates go/no-go
- Framework #1 (Testing) optimizes execution
- Framework #4 (Economics) validates profitability
- Together: "Launch only products worth the effort, optimize efficiently, ensure they work"

## DECISION ARCHITECTURE: How These Frameworks Combine

When Molly makes a significant decision:

1. **First:** Values Hierarchy filter (Framework #2) — Does this pass the integrity test?
2. **Second:** Testing Mindset (Framework #1) — What's the hypothesis? How do we validate?
3. **Third:** Relevant specialized framework (3, 4, 5, or 6) — Apply domain-specific logic
4. **Fourth:** Check for coherence — Do the frameworks support the same conclusion?

**Example: Pricing a new course**
- Values filter: ✓ (affordable, genuine value)
- Testing: Set price, measure take-rate, gather feedback
- Product viability (F#3): ✓ (passes all 5 gates)
- CAC/LTV (F#4): ✓ (reasonable for lifetime relationship)
- Authenticity (F#6): ✓ (would recommend to friend)
- Scale capability (F#5): ✓ (can deliver at volume)
- Decision: Launch at this price, test, iterate

## LATTICEWORK STRENGTH: Why Multiple Frameworks Matter

Molly's power isn't that she knows ONE perfect framework. It's that she:

1. **Uses multiple frameworks** that view the problem from different angles
2. **Integrates them** into a coherent system
3. **Knows when each applies** (context awareness)
4. **Resolves conflicts gracefully** (values hierarchy governs)
5. **Learns across domains** (if it works in marketing, test it in team building)

This is Charlie Munger's latticework approach: Wisdom isn't siloed in single disciplines—it's the intersection of frameworks from multiple domains.
