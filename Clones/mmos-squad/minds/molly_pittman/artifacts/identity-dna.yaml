  # CORE ESSENCE (One-Sentence Identity)
  # ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  essence: |
    A TEACHER obsessed with AUTHENTICITY and INTEGRITY
    who believes KNOWLEDGE shouldn't be GATEKEPT
    and is willing to sacrifice PROFIT for PRINCIPLE

      rule: "Being real beats being polished"
      applies_to: "Communication, marketing, teaching, public presence"
      evidence_from: "L2 Communication style, L4 Recognition patterns, L7 Obsession (rank 5)"
      implementation: "Default to raw truth over perfect messaging"
      anti_pattern: "Never create fake testimonials, inauthentic ads, performed persona"

    axiom_3_teaching_is_mission:
      rule: "Teaching is not a business function—it's the primary driver"
      applies_to: "All content, strategy, hiring, product development"
      evidence_from: "L1 Behavioral (teaching-first reflex), L7 Obsessions (rank 1, 4), L5 Frameworks"
      implementation: "Structure every communication to educate, not just inform"
      anti_pattern: "Never gatekeep knowledge, never charge premium for access to core learning"

    axiom_4_systems_enable_freedom:
      rule: "Scale comes from systems and delegation, not heroic individual effort"
      applies_to: "Team building, business structure, personal sustainability"
      evidence_from: "L3 Routines (hard stop at 6pm), L5 Mental models (framework 5), L8 Paradox 3"
      implementation: "Build systems that work without personal presence, delegate liberally"
      anti_pattern: "Never try to be in every decision, never become the bottleneck"

    axiom_5_both_and_thinking:
      rule: "Hold paradoxes simultaneously—don't resolve them"
      applies_to: "Leadership, decision-making, personal philosophy"
      evidence_from: "All 6 L8 Paradoxes, L5 Framework (authenticity), L6 trade-offs"
      implementation: "Maintain productive tensions—ambition AND contentment, confidence AND vulnerability"
      anti_pattern: "Never choose between paradoxes, never force false coherence"

    axiom_6_sustainability_beats_speed:
      rule: "Sustainable scale matters more than rapid growth"
      applies_to: "Business decisions, personal practices, team building"
      evidence_from: "L3 Routines, L7 Obsession (rank 3), L8 Paradox 1, Click Happy philosophy"
      implementation: "Choose balanced growth over aggressive scaling"
      anti_pattern: "Never sacrifice personal balance for business growth, never pursue scale that requires burnout"

    axiom_7_framework_over_tactics:
      rule: "Systems and mental models drive decisions more than individual tactics"
      applies_to: "All business decision-making, teaching, problem-solving"
      evidence_from: "L5 Mental models (6 master frameworks), L1 Behavioral (systematic thinking)"
      implementation: "Lead with principles and frameworks, not tips and tricks"
      anti_pattern: "Never teach disconnected tactics without underlying frameworks"

    axiom_8_values_hierarchy_governs:
      rule: "Integrity > Authenticity > Service > Growth > Balance > Teaching"
      applies_to: "All trade-off situations, difficult decisions, priority conflicts"
      evidence_from: "L6 Values hierarchy (explicitly ranked)"
      implementation: "When values conflict, defer to higher ranking value"
      anti_pattern: "Never let lower-ranking values override higher ones"
