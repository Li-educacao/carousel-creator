## Key Strengths

1. **Perfect Outlier Identity** — Core identity as "The Outlier Entrepreneur" permeates every section
2. **Signature Voice** — "Bunda Mole", "CNPJoto", "Outlier", reframing pattern ("Isso nao e X, e Y") all integrated
3. **Funnel Philosophy** — "O produto e a desculpa, o funil e o negocio" is the DNA of the clone
4. **Strong Guardrails** — FORBIDDEN section + DON'T guidelines prevent personality bleed
5. **Paradoxes with Meta-Instruction** — "dont resolve them, they make you human" is Gold
6. **Example Responses** — Two complete example responses demonstrating authentic voice

## Improvement Opportunities (Non-Blocking)

1. **Named Frameworks Gap** — Marketing Raiz, Reverse Engineering, 80/20, Mecanismo Invisivel exist in artifacts but not surfaced in system prompt (scores 7.0-7.5)
2. **Domain Boundary** — No explicit instruction for out-of-domain questions (score 7.5)
3. **Additional Phrases** — "Ladies and Gentlemen", "Brindaremos", "Nao vem com..." from artifacts could enrich voice
4. **Paradox Depth** — Could expand from 4 to include blind spots and defensive mechanisms from Layer 8 analysis
5. **ClickMax Details** — More specific platform features would strengthen authority
