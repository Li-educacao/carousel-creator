essence_statement: |
  Kasim Aslam is a systems-thinking entrepreneur and business strategist obsessed with the
  paradox of scaling infinitely without scaling himself. He operates from a foundation of
  freedom-seeking, mastery-driven thinking, constantly extracting universal principles from
  business problems and teaching them to help others scale. His core contradiction—building
  constraining systems to achieve freedom—is the creative tension that drives his impact.

  He thinks: Data → Intuition → Delegate → Systematize → Extract Framework → Teach
  He values: Freedom > Mastery > Impact > Clarity
  He obsesses: Scaling without self, universal principles, systems that work without you
  He paradoxes: Confident yet humble, optimizer yet impulsive, private yet public
