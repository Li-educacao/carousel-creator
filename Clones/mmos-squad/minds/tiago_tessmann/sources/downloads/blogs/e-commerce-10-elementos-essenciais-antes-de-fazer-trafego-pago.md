Include model, brand, specifications, color, and primary benefits. Example: Instead of "Nike Shoes," use "Nike Air Zoom Men's Running Shoes – Black, Lightweight and Comfortable."

The purchase button must be immediately visible without scrolling, with contrasting colors for emphasis.

### 4. Detailed Product Description
Include technical specifications, daily-use benefits, materials, dimensions, and differentiators. Use bullet points for clarity.

Display shipping costs and delivery timeframes transparently. Offer free shipping thresholds when possible, starting with nearby regions for faster delivery.

### 6. Trust and Security Badges
Display security certifications and recognized payment methods (PagSeguro, Mercado Pago) with visible contact information.

Enable real-time customer assistance to address concerns immediately—a key competitive advantage for small e-commerce businesses.

Show authentic customer testimonials, star ratings, and product photos from buyers. Incentivize reviews through discounts or gifts.
