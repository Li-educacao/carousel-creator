  relevance_window: "10+ years — principles are evergreen, current applications are trending upward"

# ============================================================
# DIMENSION 6: VALUE DENSITY (Max: 15)
# ============================================================

value_density_score:
  actionable_frameworks: 5  # /6 — Several proven frameworks, strong but not quite a 'toolkit' packaged for deployment
  tactical_specificity: 4  # /5 — Mix of strategic + tactical. Blog is very tactical. Books range from technical to strategic.
  case_studies_examples: 4  # /4 — Every blog post references real incidents. Books are case-study-rich.
  total: 13  # /15

  evidence:
    frameworks:
      - "5-Step Security Risk Analysis (Beyond Fear)"
      - "Schneier's Law (self-assessment heuristic)"
      - "Attack Trees (threat modeling)"

      - "'Hacker's Mind' system exploitation lens"
      - "Trust taxonomy (Liars and Outliers)"
    specificity_level: "mixed — technical books are extremely tactical (code-level), policy books are more strategic with tactical case studies"
    examples_count: 500  # Conservative estimate across 14 books + 20+ years of daily blog

  practical_value: "High. Schneier provides both theoretical frameworks and real-world examples. Blog serves as daily case study feed. Technical books include actual code. Policy books include actionable analysis frameworks."

    probability: "Medium"
    impact: "Medium"
    mitigation: "Focus on conceptual frameworks over mathematical proofs"

  - risk: "Evolving views over 30 years — older positions may contradict newer ones"
    probability: "High"
    impact: "Low"
    mitigation: "Weight recent content (2018+) higher; document evolution explicitly in Layer 8 (paradoxes)"

  - risk: "Blog content volume is massive — may need selective sampling"
    probability: "High"
    impact: "Low"
