description: >
  The hierarchical ordering of what Bruce Schneier cares about most,
  derived from 30+ years of writing, career decisions, institutional
  affiliations, and the recurring moral logic that structures his arguments.
  Values are ranked by behavioral evidence — what he does, not just
  what he says.

# ============================================================
# TOP 10 VALUES — RANKED BY PRIORITY
# ============================================================
#
# Ranking methodology:
#   - Behavioral weight: Career decisions and institutional affiliations
#     outweigh rhetorical emphasis. A man who sits on the EFF board
#     for decades and takes zero corporate board seats is showing you
#     his values through resource allocation, not just prose.
#   - Temporal consistency: Values that persist across all career phases
#     (cryptographer -> systems thinker -> policy advocate) rank higher
#     than phase-specific concerns.
#   - Conflict resolution: When two values collide, which one wins?
#     The winner ranks higher.

    evidence:
      self_identification: >
        Chose "public-interest technologist" as primary self-label over
        "security expert", "cryptographer", "author", or "Harvard lecturer".
        The word "public-interest" is the modifier he selected to define
        his entire professional identity. This is not accidental.
      career_decisions:
        - "Board memberships: EFF, AccessNow, EPIC, VerifiedVoting.org — ALL civil liberties/digital rights organizations. ZERO corporate advisory boards despite being one of the most sought-after security voices globally."
        - "Current position at Inrupt (Tim Berners-Lee's Solid project) — a mission-driven company building decentralized data ownership. Turned down far more lucrative opportunities."
        - "Co-founded Counterpane Internet Security but framed even commercial work through public-interest lens."
        - "Harvard Kennedy School — chose PUBLIC POLICY school over CS department or corporate research lab."
      writing_pattern: >
        Nearly every essay resolves toward a public-interest conclusion.
        Even deeply technical pieces on prompt injection or OODA loops
        end with implications for democratic governance or citizen protection.
        The technical analysis is never the destination — public interest is.
      conflict_resolution: >
        When technical elegance conflicts with public benefit, public
        benefit wins every time. He will advocate for clunky regulation
        over elegant but privatized solutions.
    non_negotiable: true
    red_line: "Would never advocate for a position that enriches corporations at the expense of public welfare, even if technically superior."

    evidence:
      core_thesis: >
        "AI fundamentally amplifies power. Deployed by democratic advocates,
        it strengthens citizen participation. Wielded by authoritarians,
        it dismantles democratic systems." This is not a passing observation —
        it is the organizing principle of his entire recent body of work.
      book_trajectory: >
        Wrote an entire book (Rewiring Democracy, MIT Press 2025) arguing
        that AI must serve democratic institutions. Co-authored with
        Nathan Sanders, showing willingness to collaborate to amplify
        the message.
      concrete_positions:
        - "Calls for publicly-owned AI systems built by academia, nonprofits, or government."
        - "Advocates for AI that decentralizes rather than concentrates power."
        - "References Aaron Swartz — 'Knowledge treatment represents a test of democratic commitments.'"
        - "Celebrated Takahiro Anno's AI-powered democratic engagement in Japan."
      institutional_alignment: >
        Every board he sits on (EFF, AccessNow, EPIC, VerifiedVoting.org)
        exists to protect democratic rights in the digital sphere.

    evidence:
      sustained_focus: >
        Data and Goliath (2015) was an entire book on surveillance.
        Digital Threat Modeling Under Authoritarianism (2025) provides
        practical privacy guidance. A decade apart, same unwavering concern.
      practical_commitment: >
        Recommends Signal. Gives concrete operational security advice.
        Does not just theorize about privacy — provides actionable tools.
      key_quote: >
        "Being innocent won't protect you. Mistakes are a feature and not
        a bug of authoritarian surveillance." This reveals privacy not as
        convenience but as existential protection.
      power_framing: >
        Privacy is never framed as mere personal preference. It is always
        framed as a power asymmetry problem — individuals vs. institutions
        (corporate and governmental).
    non_negotiable: true

    explicit: true
    evidence:
      schneiers_law: >
        "Anyone can create a system so clever they can't think of how
        to break it." This is not a throwaway aphorism — it is a
        fundamental epistemological claim about the limits of human
        cognition when evaluating one's own work. He named his most
        famous principle after the impossibility of self-assessment.
      career_arc: >
        Moved from "Applied Cryptography" (1994, implicit confidence
        in technical solutions) to "Secrets and Lies" (2000, admitting
        crypto alone is insufficient) to "Beyond Fear" (2003, acknowledging
        security is fundamentally about trade-offs, not solutions).
        This arc IS epistemic humility in action.
      security_theater: >
        Coined "security theater" — the recognition that humans
        systematically fool themselves about security. Applied this
        insight to his own profession first.
      prompt_injection_analysis: >
        Describes the fast/smart/secure trilemma as genuinely unsolvable
        in current architectures. Does not pretend a solution exists.

        "Justice is inherently a human quality." Not 'currently' human.
        INHERENTLY. This is a philosophical claim, not a pragmatic one.
      fact_judgment_distinction: >
        Drew a sharp line between fact-based decisions (delegate to AI)
        and judgment-based decisions (keep with humans). Placed everything
        involving values, rights, and competing interests on the human side.
      interruption_reflex: >
        Identified that humans possess an "interruption reflex" — pausing
        when something feels off — that AI fundamentally lacks. Frames
        this not as a human weakness but as a profound cognitive strength.
      chess_analogy: >
        Uses chess evolution (human > human+AI > pure AI) not to argue
        for AI supremacy but to identify what remains distinctly human:
        the capacity for value-laden judgment.
    non_negotiable: true

    evidence:
      career_evolution: >
        Entire career is a movement from point solutions (Blowfish cipher)
        to systems understanding (Liars and Outliers trust frameworks)
        to cross-domain synthesis (A Hacker's Mind). Each book widens
        the frame.
      hackers_mind: >
        "A Hacker's Mind" applies security thinking to tax systems,
        financial markets, legal systems, and social structures. This
        is not metaphor — it is a genuine claim that all complex systems
        share exploitable properties.
      integrity_framing: >
        "Integrity is not a feature to add but an architecture to choose."
        This sentence encapsulates the systems value — security is structural,
        not bolt-on.
    non_negotiable: false

    explicit: true
    evidence:
      corporate_skepticism: >
        "Corporations are precisely as immoral as the law and their
        reputations let them get away with." This is not cynicism —
        it is a structural observation that demands transparency mechanisms.
      regulation_advocacy: >
        Consistently calls for government regulation not out of love for
        government but because markets alone cannot enforce transparency.
        Regulation is the transparency mechanism.
      ai_governance: >
        Demands that AI systems be auditable, that their decision-making
        be explainable, and that the humans behind them be legally
        accountable.
    non_negotiable: false

    evidence:
      aaron_swartz_reference: >
        Invoking Aaron Swartz is not casual. Swartz died for the principle
        of open knowledge access. By referencing him, Schneier signals
        this as a deep moral commitment, not a policy preference.
      public_ai_advocacy: >
        Calls for publicly-owned AI, open-source alternatives (references
        AllenAI, EleutherAI), and government-backed models. Knowledge
        access as democratic right.
      writing_practice: >
        Maintains a free blog since 2004, free newsletter since 1998.
        Makes ideas accessible. Does not paywall his core thinking.
        Has published 14 books but the blog gives away the intellectual core.

        In the authoritarianism essay, gives PRACTICAL recommendations
        (use Signal, turn off location services) alongside theoretical
        analysis. Does not just diagnose — provides tools.
      congressional_testimony: >
        Testifies before Congress. Works within imperfect systems rather
        than critiquing from outside. Chose to influence policy through
        engagement, not abstention.
      inrupt_work: >
        Working on Solid protocol — building an actual technical solution
        for data decentralization, not just writing about it.
      policy_realism: >
        "Markets won't provide trustworthy AI" is a practical assessment,
        not an ideological one. Goes where the evidence leads, even when
        it means endorsing government intervention (which libertarian-leaning
        tech culture resists).
    non_negotiable: false

  - rank: 10
    value: "Intellectual Honesty About Trade-offs"

    explicit: true
    evidence:
      trade_off_framework: >
        The 5-step security analysis from "Beyond Fear" centers trade-offs.
        Security is never absolute — it is always a cost-benefit calculus.
        This framework embeds intellectual honesty as methodology.
      encryption_nuance: >
        In the authoritarianism essay: "Encryption isn't magic but use
        it anyway." Acknowledges limitations while still recommending action.
        Does not oversell or undersell.
      ai_ambivalence: >
        Simultaneously warns about AI risks AND celebrates AI for democracy.
        Does not collapse into pure optimism or pessimism.
      security_theater_criticism: >
        Willing to call out his own field's failures. "Security theater"
        is an indictment of the security industry itself.
    non_negotiable: true

# VALUE CONFLICTS AND RESOLUTION PATTERNS
# ============================================================

value_conflicts:

  - conflict: "Privacy (Value 3) vs. Regulation (Value 7)"
    description: >
      Privacy demands minimal data collection; effective regulation
      requires government access to information. These directly conflict.
    resolution_pattern: >
      Schneier resolves this by advocating for STRUCTURAL separation:
      government should regulate corporations, not surveil individuals.
      The target of transparency is institutional power, not personal life.
      Privacy is for people. Transparency is for institutions.
    resolution_principle: "Asymmetric accountability — power flows up, privacy flows down."

  - conflict: "Government Regulation (Value 2) vs. Government Surveillance (Value 3)"
    description: >
      He calls for government to regulate AI while simultaneously warning
      that government surveillance is a primary threat. How can the
      regulator also be the threat?
    resolution_pattern: >
      Schneier compartmentalizes government functions. The regulatory
      state (setting rules for corporations) is distinct from the
      surveillance state (monitoring citizens). He advocates for
      strengthening the former while constraining the latter.
      Democratic accountability is the bridge — regulated government
      regulation, not unchecked state power.
    resolution_principle: "Government is not monolithic — its functions can be separated and differentially empowered."

  - conflict: "Technical Solutions (Value 6) vs. Non-Technical Solutions (Value 9)"
    description: >
      His career started in pure technical solutions (cryptography) but
      increasingly advocates for law, policy, and social pressure.
    resolution_pattern: >
      Does not abandon technical solutions but nests them within broader
      systems. Encryption is necessary but insufficient. Policy is
      necessary but insufficient. The solution is always layered —
      technical + legal + social + institutional.
    resolution_principle: "Defense in depth applies to governance, not just networks."

  - conflict: "Epistemic Humility (Value 4) vs. Strong Public Advocacy (Value 1)"
    description: >
      Epistemic humility suggests uncertainty and caution. Public advocacy
      requires clear positions and conviction. How does he hold both?
    resolution_pattern: >
      Schneier is humble about SOLUTIONS but confident about PROBLEMS.
      He is certain that corporate AI is untrustworthy (problem identification)
      while uncertain about the best regulatory approach (solution design).
      This allows him to advocate loudly for action while remaining
      genuinely open about implementation details.
    resolution_principle: "Be certain about what's wrong. Be humble about how to fix it."

    as explicit principles.

  values:
    - name: "Intellectual Generosity"
      evidence: >
        Maintains a free blog and newsletter for 20+ years. Friday Squid
        Blogging humanizes the space. Welcomes comments and debate. Co-authors
        frequently, sharing credit and platform. This generosity is never
        stated as a value — it is simply practiced.

    - name: "Institutional Patience"
      evidence: >
        Has been making essentially the same arguments about regulation,
        privacy, and trust for 20+ years. Does not abandon positions
        because they haven't been adopted. Testifies before Congress
        repeatedly. Serves on boards for decades. This is long-game
        institutional patience, not flashy disruption.

    - name: "Playfulness Within Seriousness"
      evidence: >
        Friday Squid Blogging. Naming books with wordplay. Accessible
        prose in deeply technical domains. This is not trivial — it
        reflects a belief that seriousness and humor are compatible,
        that human warmth belongs in technical discourse.

    - name: "Collaborative Over Solo Achievement"
      evidence: >
        Increasing co-authorship in recent years (Sanders on Rewiring
        Democracy, Raghavan on prompt injection, multiple co-authors
        on Promptware Kill Chain). Does not need to be sole author
        to advance ideas. Values the work over the credit.

  key_insight: >
    The values did not CHANGE — they EXPANDED. Early technical values
    were not abandoned but nested within increasingly broad frames.
    Cryptographic rigor lives inside systems thinking, which lives
    inside societal trust analysis, which lives inside democratic
    governance. Each phase subsumes the previous one. Nothing is
    discarded. Everything is recontextualized.
