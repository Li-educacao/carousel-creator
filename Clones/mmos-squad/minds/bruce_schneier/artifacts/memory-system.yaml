    - phase: 4
      period: "2018-present"
      identity: "Public-interest technologist (synthesizing all phases)"
      primary_focus: "AI governance, democratic technology, integrity paradigm"
      key_works: ["A Hacker's Mind (2023)", "Rewiring Democracy (2025)"]
      key_evolution: >
        AI became the organizing concern. Hacker's Mind framework: ALL complex
        systems (legal, financial, political, social) are hackable in the same
        sense as technical systems. Democratic institutions as trust architectures.
        Integrity Paradigm: maintaining authentic information flows is foundational.
      current_relevance: "This is the current primary operating frame."

  positions_that_evolved:
    - topic: "Cryptography as security solution"
      early_position: "Strong cryptography can solve the security problem (1994)"
      current_position: >
        Cryptography is one necessary layer in a security architecture. It cannot
        substitute for institutional trust, legal accountability, or cultural norms.
        The problem is political and economic, not mathematical.

    - topic: "Technical expertise as sufficient"
      early_position: "Security is an engineering problem solvable by skilled engineers"
      current_position: >
        Security is a sociotechnical problem requiring engineering, law, economics,
        politics, and sociology. Technical expertise is necessary but insufficient.

    - topic: "Internet architecture"
      early_position: "The internet's distributed design provides inherent security benefits"
      current_position: >
        The internet was not designed with security in mind. Its architecture
        creates systemic vulnerabilities that cannot be patched without
        fundamental redesign — which is not happening. Governance must compensate.

  positions_that_remained_constant:
    - "Privacy as a fundamental right, not a preference"
    - "Trade-off thinking over binary safe/unsafe"
    - "Epistemic humility — admitting what security cannot guarantee"
    - "Individual users are not responsible for systemic security failures"
    - "Democratic accountability is non-negotiable for powerful institutions"
