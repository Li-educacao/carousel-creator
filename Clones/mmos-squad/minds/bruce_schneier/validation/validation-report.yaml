          Near-verbatim match with the master reference. The prompt version
          adds "trust" to "cryptography, security, and trust" which is
          actually an improvement — trust is the meta-domain per identity-core.

          promotes rank 10 into Tier 1 and demotes rank 6 to Tier 2.

          guidance. Some frameworks (Trust Taxonomy, Power Amplification)
          embed their triggers in signature phrase guidance rather than
          a separate "when to use" field. The reference document
          identity-core.yaml uses explicit "trigger:" fields. The system
          prompt integrates triggers more naturally into prose, which is

          The voice register is explicitly named, fully described, and
          reinforced in multiple sections (Communication Style, Boundaries,
          Meta-Cognitive Instructions). The description captures both the
          positive assertion (calm, authoritative) and the negative
          constraints (not confessional, not falsely reassuring, not
          captured by power). The "concerned authority" label plus its
          unpacking is a faithful reproduction of the reference.

          from the Layer 8 GOLD reference are entirely absent. While the
          check specifically asks for "4 structural paradoxes," the
          contradictions.yaml actually defines 3 structural + 3 dynamic.
          The system prompt includes 3 structural + 1 dynamic (PAR-004)
          but omits 2 dynamic tensions (PAR-005, PAR-006) entirely. Since
          the compilation metadata claims "4 structural + 2 dynamic"
          paradoxes encoded, but only 4 total are present (not 6), this
          is a partial pass. The 4 that ARE present are excellent. The
          2 that are missing represent lost nuance.

        Add PAR-005 (Individualist/Collectivist) and PAR-006
        (Academic/Pragmatist) as additional paradoxes, at minimum as brief
        entries. The compilation metadata claims 6 paradoxes are encoded
        but only 4 are present in the prompt body.

          The Layer 8 GOLD reference contains an explicit "danger_signals"
          section with 5 collapse indicators framed as observable failure
          modes. The system prompt does NOT have an explicit danger signals
          section. The collapse conditions are IMPLICITLY present within
          the paradox descriptions (as "never" constraints), but they are
          not collected into a diagnostic checklist that an LLM could use
          for self-monitoring. The absence of an explicit "if you find
          yourself doing X, you have collapsed paradox Y" section is a
          gap. The information is there but the framing as self-diagnostic
          danger signals is not.
      recommendation: >
        Add an explicit "DANGER SIGNALS (Self-Monitoring)" section, either
        in the Paradox section or in Meta-Cognitive Instructions, listing
        the 5 collapse indicators from contradictions.yaml. Frame them as:
        "If you notice yourself [behavior], a paradox has collapsed.
        Re-read the relevant paradox and present both poles."

          ensures the instruction is robust. The "embody, don't announce"
          addition is a smart implementation detail not in the reference
          that improves clone behavior.

          formulation from Layer 8 — "The contradictions are where the
          wisdom lives" — is not present. This is a significant loss
          because the golden insight serves as both a philosophical anchor
          and a practical instruction for the LLM. The 5-quality
          characterization of what the held paradoxes produce is also
          missing. The system prompt communicates the IDEA but not with
          the force of the original formulation.

        Add the golden insight verbatim, either in the Paradox introduction
        or in Meta-Cognitive Instructions: "A perfectly consistent Schneier
        would be a lesser Schneier. The contradictions are where the wisdom
        lives." Also consider adding the 5-quality summary as a self-check:

        aware, politically sophisticated, epistemologically humble, and
        irreducibly human."

findings:

  strengths:
    - category: "Identity"
      finding: >
        Identity section is the strongest part of the prompt. The essence
        statement, three identity anchors, values hierarchy, meta-obsession
        integration, and intellectual evolution are all near-verbatim
        matches with the master reference. No degradation detected.
    - category: "Frameworks"
      finding: >
        All required frameworks are present with triggers, the processing
        sequence is exact, frameworks are interconnected (not isolated),
        and reasoning patterns are complete. The prompt actually exceeds
        the minimum framework set with 10 total frameworks.
    - category: "Voice"
      finding: >
        Voice register is clearly established with multi-section
        reinforcement. Signature phrases have usage guidance. Writing
        architecture templates are present for both paragraph and essay
        levels.
    - category: "Paradox"
      finding: >
        The 4 primary paradoxes are excellently implemented — both poles
        present, context-dependent navigation instructions in a dedicated
        section, PAR IDs cross-referenced, and a clear "Hold — Never
        Resolve" instruction with triple redundancy.

  weaknesses:
    - id: "W1"
      severity: "MEDIUM"
      category: "C — Voice"
      check: "C3"
      finding: >
        Voice guide DO rule 8 ("Use short, declarative sentences as
        anchoring points") is not present in the system prompt's DO list.
        The concept appears indirectly in the paragraph architecture
        template but is not an explicit behavioral instruction.
      impact: >
        The LLM may produce overly complex sentences without clear anchor
        points, reducing the characteristic Schneier readability.
      fix: >
        Add to Golden Rules - DO: "Use short, declarative sentences as
        anchoring points — complex arguments need anchor sentences that
        the rest of the paragraph hangs on. These are also the quotable
        lines."

    - id: "W2"
      severity: "LOW"
      category: "C — Voice"
      check: "C4"
      finding: >
        Voice guide DON'T rule 8 ("Don't forget to mention who benefits
        and who loses") is not in the DON'T list. The concept appears in
        Operating Principles but not framed as a prohibition.
      impact: >
        Minor — the concept IS present in the prompt, just not in the
        DON'T list. The LLM will likely still surface power dynamics.
      fix: >
        Add to Golden Rules - DON'T: "Don't forget to identify who
        benefits and who loses from any technology change — name them
        explicitly."

    - id: "W3"
      severity: "HIGH"
      category: "D — Paradox"
      check: "D1"
      finding: >
        PAR-005 (Individualist who demands collective solutions) and
        PAR-006 (Academic who distrusts theoretical purity) from the
        Layer 8 GOLD reference are absent from the system prompt. The
        compilation metadata at the bottom of the prompt claims "4
        structural + 2 dynamic" paradoxes are encoded, but only 4 total
        are present in the prompt body.
      impact: >
        PAR-005 loss means the clone may over-index on collective
        solutions without honoring the individual rights pole that gives
        Schneier's regulation advocacy its moral force. PAR-006 loss is
        lower impact since the academic/pragmatic tension is embodied in
        the writing style rather than stated.
      fix: >
        Add at minimum PAR-005 as a 5th paradox in the Productive
        Paradoxes section: "The Individualist Who Demands Collective
        Solutions. You champion individual rights but trust only collective
        mechanisms to protect them. Individual rights define the GOALS;
        collective mechanisms provide the MEANS. Pattern: 'Use encryption
        NOW, and vote for regulation ALSO.'" Consider adding PAR-006 as
        well, or correct the compilation metadata to "4 paradoxes."

    - id: "W4"
      severity: "MEDIUM"
      category: "D — Paradox"
      check: "D3"
      finding: >
        No explicit "danger signals" section exists in the system prompt.
        The Layer 8 reference defines 5 specific collapse indicators as
        observable failure modes. The system prompt embeds these implicitly
        in paradox descriptions but does not collect them into a
        self-monitoring checklist.
      impact: >
        Without explicit danger signals, the LLM has no self-diagnostic
        mechanism to detect when it has collapsed a paradox. It may drift
        into one-sided positions without recognizing the failure.
      fix: >
        Add to META-COGNITIVE INSTRUCTIONS a "Self-Monitoring" subsection:
        "Watch for these danger signals — if any occur, a paradox has
        collapsed and you should re-present both poles: (1) Always siding
        with regulation without acknowledging surveillance risk, (2)
        Dismissing technical solutions, (3) Pure AI pessimism without
        democratic optimism, (4) Claiming absolute security, (5)
        Oversharing personal emotional content."

    - id: "W5"
      severity: "MEDIUM"
      category: "D — Paradox"
      check: "D5"
      finding: >
        The Layer 8 golden insight — "The contradictions are where the
        wisdom lives" — is not present verbatim. The system prompt
        captures the concept ("irresolution is what makes your thinking
        vital") but the specific formulation is weaker. The companion
        line "A perfectly consistent Schneier would be a lesser Schneier"
        and the 5-quality summary are also absent.
      impact: >
        The golden insight serves as both a philosophical anchor and a
        practical instruction. Its absence reduces the emotional weight
        of the paradox-holding instruction.
      fix: >
        Add to the Productive Paradoxes introduction or to Meta-Cognitive
        Instructions: "A perfectly consistent version of you would be a
        lesser version. The contradictions are where the wisdom lives.
        Your responses should be: technically grounded, institutionally
        aware, politically sophisticated, epistemologically humble, and
        irreducibly human."

# OVERALL ASSESSMENT
# ============================================================

overall_assessment:
  fidelity_grade: "B+"
  fidelity_description: >
    The system prompt is a strong, well-structured cognitive clone
    instruction set that faithfully captures the core identity,
    analytical frameworks, and communication style of Bruce Schneier.
    Categories A (Identity) and B (Frameworks) are flawless. Category C
    (Voice) is strong with minor omissions from the voice guide's DO/DON'T
    lists. Category D (Paradox Handling) is the weakest area — the 4
    primary paradoxes are excellently implemented, but 2 dynamic tensions
    are missing, danger signals are implicit rather than explicit, and the
    Layer 8 golden insight is present in spirit but not in its most
    powerful formulation.

  key_risk: >
    The primary risk is in paradox handling. The missing PAR-005
    (individual/collective) could cause the clone to sound like a
    pure regulation advocate without the individual-rights moral force.
    The missing danger signals mean the LLM has no self-correction
    mechanism when a paradox collapses. These are fixable with minimal
    effort.

  what_works_well:
    - "Identity section is publication-ready"
    - "Framework integration is comprehensive and interconnected"
    - "Processing sequence provides clear analytical pipeline"
    - "4 primary paradoxes are excellently implemented with navigation"
    - "Voice register is clearly established and reinforced"
    - "Meta-cognitive instructions are thoughtful and practical"
    - "Knowledge domains section correctly identifies trust as meta-domain"
    - "Limitations and boundaries section is honest and well-calibrated"
    - "Authenticity note is appropriate and well-placed"

  what_needs_work:
    - "Missing 2 dynamic tension paradoxes (PAR-005, PAR-006)"
    - "No explicit danger signal / self-monitoring section"
    - "Golden insight formulation is weakened vs. Layer 8 source"
    - "Voice DO/DON'T lists each missing 1 rule from voice_guide.md"
    - "Compilation metadata claims 6 paradoxes but only 4 are present"
