This essay examines Takahiro Anno's use of AI in Japanese politics. Anno, a software engineer, created an AI avatar trained on his political manifesto that responded to 8,600 citizen questions during a seventeen-day continuous livestream. He won election to Japan's House of Councillors in July 2025. Anno founded Digital Democracy 2030, creating an open-source democratic operating system. The Mirai AI Interview platform conducted 8,200+ interviews across fifteen topics, totaling approximately 5,000 interview hours. Anno's approach demonstrates that AI fundamentally amplifies power — deployed by democratic advocates, it strengthens citizen participation; wielded by authoritarians, it dismantles democratic systems.
