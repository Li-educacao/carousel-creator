Established human management principles apply remarkably well to hybrid human-AI teams. Four domains where AI excels: speed, scale, scope, and sophistication. Key lessons from Anthropic's Claude Research: (1) Delegation matters — 80% of performance differences attributed to computing resources leveraged via parallel agents; (2) Iteration matters — multiple competing AI teams return results twice as quickly; (3) Effective information sharing matters — enable agents to write to common file systems. The central insight: understanding teams and optimizing member performance is paramount. Different models should be positioned where they succeed most.
