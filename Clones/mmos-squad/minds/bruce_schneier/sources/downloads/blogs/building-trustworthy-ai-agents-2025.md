Personal AI assistants rest on a flawed assumption: that we can trust systems we haven't made trustworthy. The core problem stems from inadequate integrity controls. Security traditionally addresses CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, availability), but we've never properly solved integrity. Schneier proposes separating personal data stores from AI systems, arguing that engineering expertise for AI is orthogonal to security expertise for data protection. A trustworthy personal data store should include: broad accessibility, multi-model compatibility, verifiable accuracy, user control, security, and usability.
