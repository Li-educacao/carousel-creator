Threat modeling is the process of determining what security measures make sense in your particular situation. The average American's threat model is changing — from corporate surveillance to government surveillance and weaponization of personal data. Government has vast data (IRS, OPM, Census, DHS, etc.) plus corporate surveillance data (Google, Meta, phones, cars, IoT). Key points: targeted attacks don't scale but mass surveillance affects everyone; being innocent won't protect you — mistakes are a feature not a bug of authoritarian surveillance; encryption isn't magic but use it anyway (recommends Signal); data poisoning doesn't help as much as you'd think; effective opposition requires being online. Trade-offs depend on personal goals: keeping your head down, protesting legally, or active resistance.
