Data integrity is becoming more critical than ever with AI systems. Most attacks against AI systems are integrity attacks — stickers on road signs to fool AI driving, prompt injection attacks. The AI model can't distinguish between legitimate data and malicious input or commands. Schneier proposes the word "integrous" to describe systems with integrity. The fundamental question parallels earlier eras: In the 1960s, the internet was designed to answer "Can we build an available network in a world of availability failures?" Then privacy: "Can we build a confidential network in a world of confidentiality failures?" Now: "Can we build an integrous network in a world of integrity failures?" Reboot is an integrity measure. Undo button is an integrity measure. We need research into integrous system design.
