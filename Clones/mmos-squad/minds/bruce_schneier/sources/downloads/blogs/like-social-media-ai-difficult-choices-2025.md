Social media promised to amplify individual voices but ended up controlling users' attention and data. AI faces similar crossroads. Four pivotal policy choices: (1) Courts must clarify if AI can circumvent existing law, (2) Congress must pass privacy protection, (3) States should tax AI companies to fund addressing harms, (4) Users should explore alternative products from nonprofit and government sources. The EU implemented comprehensive data privacy regulation nearly a decade ago; American companies comply for EU customers but face no comparable US requirements. Alternatives exist: AllenAI, EleutherAI, and government-backed models from Singapore, Indonesia, and Switzerland.
