AI is already pervading democratic government across executive, judicial, and legislative branches. Healthcare: AI used to approve and deny Medicare coverage for 30 million Americans. Judiciary: Colombian judge first publicly used AI in ruling (2023), followed by US federal judges. Legislature: 20% of US state staffers report using AI, first law written entirely by AI passed in Brazil (2023). Key principle: AI should be applied in ways that decentralize rather than concentrate power. We are not going to be fully governed by AI soon, but we are already being governed with AI.
