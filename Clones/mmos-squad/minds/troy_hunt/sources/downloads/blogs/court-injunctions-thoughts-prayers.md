Troy Hunt argues that court injunctions issued following data breaches are largely ineffective at protecting victims, comparing them to symbolic "thoughts and prayers" offered after tragedies.

## The Problem with Injunctions

Hunt uses two Australian cases to illustrate his point. When law firm HWL Ebsworth obtained an injunction against Russian ransomware group ALPHV/BlackCat, the hackers responded with "Fuck you fuckers" and dumped the data anyway. Similarly, when Qantas received an injunction following their 2025 breach, Hunt notes the restraining order proved unable to prevent public release of the stolen information.

## Limited Reach

The injunctions only affect three categories of people:
- Those aware the injunction exists
- Law-abiding individuals
- People subject to Australian jurisdiction

Criminals operating internationally ignore these orders entirely. The data was subsequently published on clear web file-sharing services despite the legal restrictions.

## Unintended Consequences

The injunctions prevent legitimate organizations from helping victims. Hunt notes that Have I Been Pwned cannot load the Qantas data to notify subscribers, preventing customers from learning their information circulates online. Security researchers and journalists also face restrictions.

## Real Benefits

Hunt suggests the primary beneficiary is the company, not customers. Legal action allows firms to demonstrate they "did everything possible" when defending against inevitable class action lawsuits—a point emphasizing corporate protection over victim assistance.

## Update

The Qantas data was publicly released exactly as predicted, confirming the injunction's ineffectiveness at preventing disclosure.
