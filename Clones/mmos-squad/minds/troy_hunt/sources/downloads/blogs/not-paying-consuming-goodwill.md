Hunt challenges the popular adage that "if you're not paying for the product, you are the product," arguing this phrase is often misused to suggest every free service has a hidden commercial motive.

He traces the saying's origins to television advertising models, where viewers watch free content supported by advertisers. However, Hunt contends the term oversimplifies motivations behind free software and services.

## Personal Projects Cited

Hunt illustrates his point through numerous free projects created without profit expectations:

- His early OWASP Top 10 security series took 18 months to complete purely to solve workplace problems
- ASafaWeb addressed ASP.NET misconfiguration issues with zero monetization plans
- Why No HTTPS and HTTPS is Easy were built spontaneously without compensation
- Password Purgatory exists simply to confound spammers
- Have I Been Pwned originated from two personal motivations: learning Azure cloud platforms and addressing his own exposure in the Adobe breach

## Core Argument

Hunt emphasizes that many creators depend on "goodwill" from open-source tools and services. He notes that paying for products doesn't eliminate being "the product"—YouTube Premium, Netflix, and Disqus users remain data subjects despite subscription fees.

He concludes the phrase has become reflexively applied without meaningful analysis of actual creator intentions or user experiences.
