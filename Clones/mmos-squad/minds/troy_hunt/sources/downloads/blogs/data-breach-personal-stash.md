Troy Hunt explores how stolen data circulates within an underground ecosystem, using a baseball card trading analogy to explain the mechanics of data breach proliferation. Unlike physical trades, digital data replicates infinitely when shared among criminals.

## The Trading Ecosystem

Hunt describes personal "stashes" of breaches—collections of high-profile incidents like MySpace, Adobe, and LinkedIn—that get traded repeatedly across platforms. These compilations fuel criminal marketplaces where billions of personal records flow continuously.

## Dark Web Marketplaces

Two notable platforms exemplified this pattern:

- **RaidForums**: Operated by Diogo Santos Coelho starting at age 14; he was arrested at 21 after running the service for years.
- **BreachForums**: Run by Conor Fitzpatrick, who was 20 when arrested for managing the platform.

## Commercial Breach Services

Several services monetized breached data for profit:

- **We Leak Info**: Operated by two 22-year-olds; one received a 2-year prison sentence
- **LeakedSource**: Provided passwords in cleartext and was actively promoted on hacking forums
- **Leakbase**: Went dark in 2017 following the Hansa marketplace takedown

## Critical Observation

Hunt notes these services share common characteristics: names incorporating "leak," attempts at anonymity, and terms-of-service clauses claiming "personal use only"—ineffective legal shields against prosecution.

## Current Threat

A recently discovered service mirrors this pattern exactly, suggesting the ecosystem remains active despite law enforcement efforts.
