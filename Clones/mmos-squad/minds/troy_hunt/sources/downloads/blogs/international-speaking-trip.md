Troy Hunt provides an exhaustive, candid account of his five-week international speaking tour across the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Switzerland in October 2016. Rather than presenting only glamorous highlights, Hunt documents both the professional accomplishments and personal costs of extensive travel.

## Key Details

**Duration and Scope:** 21 days covering 10 hotels, 10 flights, and 54 hours of flying time.

## Professional Activities

- Five two-day security workshops in London, Glasgow, Copenhagen, and Zurich
- Speaking engagements at conferences including Scottish Software Conference, Danish .NET user group, Swiss Cyber Storm, and WIRED Security event
- Content creation for Pluralsight courses during transit
- Continued maintenance of "Have I Been Pwned" database with breach data processing

## Personal Challenges

Hunt misses his son's seventh birthday and is absent when the child requires stitches after an injury. His wife manages household responsibilities while recovering from chronic back pain, undergoing spinal surgery during his trip. He experiences loneliness, fatigue, and difficult hotel accommodations, particularly one London location with a bedroom accessed through a café.

## Productivity Strategy

Hunt maximizes travel downtime through business-class seating (justified by workflow opportunities), editing video content, processing data breaches, and working on technical projects using dual laptops to manage battery limitations.

## Balanced Perspective

While sharing beautiful photographs from scenic locations, Hunt emphasizes the exhausting reality behind social media's glamorous travel narrative, including isolation, family sacrifice, and continuous work demands throughout the journey.
