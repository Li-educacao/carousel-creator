Troy Hunt announces Project Svalbard, an initiative to find a new home for Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) through acquisition. The project represents a significant shift from operating HIBP as a solo endeavor to building a better-resourced structure.

## Background and Context

Hunt explains that HIBP emerged from his observation in 2013 that data breaches were becoming increasingly prevalent. The service launched in December 2013 to help people discover whether their personal information appeared in known breaches. By 2019, HIBP had grown substantially, containing approximately 8 billion breached records with nearly 3 million notification subscribers.

The service achieved remarkable scale: "150k unique visitors to the site on a normal day, 10M on an abnormal day" along with millions of API requests daily. Despite this growth, Hunt managed everything independently—every line of code, configuration decision, and breach disclosure fell to him alone.

## The Burnout Point

Hunt candidly discusses reaching near-burnout during January 2019 when Collection #1 triggered unprecedented attention. While at a conference in Norway with his family, he experienced simultaneous pressure from massive media attention and personal time with loved ones. This prompted recognition that change was necessary: "I was getting very close to burn-out."

The increased workload forced significant lifestyle adjustments. His Twitter activity dropped 72% between January and May 2019, and blog post frequency declined substantially despite maintaining weekly video updates.

## Why Project Svalbard?

Hunt selected the name from Norway's Svalbard Global Seed Vault, drawing parallels to HIBP storing valuable information for humanity's benefit. The name resonates personally—Norway hosted his first international speaking engagement nearly five years earlier, where he received universal positive feedback. Additionally, the vault holds approximately one billion seeds, mirroring HIBP's massive dataset scale.

## Seven Core Commitments

Hunt outlines his non-negotiable principles for HIBP's future:

1. Consumer searches remain completely free and without barriers
2. He continues as an integral part of HIBP going forward
3. Significant capability expansion becomes possible with proper resources
4. Reaching larger audiences across the global community
5. Enhanced focus on changing consumer password management behavior
6. Better support for organizations protecting their users
7. More responsible disclosure processes and additional data sourcing

## Strategic Approach

Working with KPMG's Mergers and Acquisition practice, Hunt began formal acquisition discussions with respected organizations. He emphasizes taking time to explore options thoroughly rather than rushing into partnerships. The process involves "some very serious discussions" about organizational fit, alignment with his objectives, and personal considerations including family impact.

Hunt explicitly rejected building a venture-backed company or self-funding expansion, noting such approaches would increase his immediate responsibilities at a time requiring burden reduction.

## Future Vision

Hunt expresses excitement about expanding HIBP's ecosystem role. He envisions a future where the service could "source and process much more data, proactively reach out to impacted organisations, guide them through the process of handling the incident" and address credential stuffing attacks more effectively.

He concludes by reflecting on HIBP as fulfilling his decades-old dream of creating software with global positive impact, noting "Project Svalbard is the realisation of that dream."
