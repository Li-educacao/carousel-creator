Troy Hunt marks a significant milestone in this post—the 400th installment of his weekly video series, which he has maintained consistently since September 23, 2016.

## Main Message

Hunt reflects on the personal significance of this commitment, noting that "Every single week since the 23rd of September in 2016 regardless of location, health, stress and all sorts of other crazy things that have gone on in my life for nearly the last 8 years now, I've done a video."

He describes how these weekly videos serve a dual purpose—they provide value to his audience while simultaneously offering him therapeutic benefits. During particularly stressful periods, the act of creating content and focusing on the material has provided mental reprieve. Hunt explains that he previously wrote about managing stress and has experienced numerous instances where his mindset shifted positively once he began recording.

## Gratitude

Hunt extends thanks to his audience for their engagement, comments, and support. He credits viewers with helping maintain his mental wellbeing by providing a platform to discuss technology topics alongside lighter subjects like coffee and beer.

## References and Notable Items
