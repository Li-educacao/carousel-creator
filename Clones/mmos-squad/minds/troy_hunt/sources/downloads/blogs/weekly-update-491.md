Troy Hunt discusses his recent smart home automation experiments in this weekly update. He describes attempting to create an ESP32 Bluetooth bridge to operate Yale locks remotely, which ultimately proved unsuccessful.

## Smart Lock Experiments

The core issue centered on reliability. Hunt explains that "BLE is a bit too passive to detect state changes," meaning the bridge couldn't effectively track lock status unless actively communicating. This fundamental limitation made the solution impractical for his needs.

## WiFi Infrastructure Focus

Rather than continuing with Bluetooth technology, Hunt has shifted his focus to strengthening his home's WiFi network infrastructure. He believes improving overall connectivity might resolve the lock responsiveness problems he's experiencing.

## Alternative Lock Options

Hunt also mentions exploring alternative smart lock options, noting that "those Aqara U400s look _really_ sweet" as a potential replacement for his current Yale locks. These devices appear to represent a different technological approach that may better suit his automation goals.

The update concludes with links to audio and video versions of the weekly update, available through Apple Podcasts, YouTube, Spotify, and RSS feeds. Readers can also access subscription options for regular updates.
