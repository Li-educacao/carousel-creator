On November 5, 2012, Troy Hunt observes that Anonymous and related hacktivist groups have launched coordinated attacks against numerous targets including PayPal, ImageShack, and various Australian websites. However, Hunt argues these attacks represent a fundamental shift from genuine activism to simple opportunism.

## The Problem with Recent Attacks

Hunt examines specific targets hit during the November 5 campaign: Ascension Australia, Semcorp, and the Quality Lifestyle Alliance. He questions the coherence of these targets, noting that "taking down a hippie festival, a small web development company with poor security and an NGO helping people with disabilities" serves no clear political purpose.

The author contrasts these random attacks with earlier hacktivist campaigns that had identifiable causes. He references the 2010 Anonymous attacks on Visa and Mastercard for blocking WikiLeaks donations, and the HB Gary hack as examples where attackers had explicit motivations.

## The Decline of Motivated Hacking

Hunt highlights how the narrative around significant breaches has become disconnected from stated causes. He describes a case where hacktivists claimed to have compromised the FBI and obtained millions of Apple device IDs, when in reality "a much smaller number of device IDs had been pulled from an app developer" with lax security practices.

## Demographics Behind the Mask

The author examines the actual people behind anonymous attacks, citing examples like Ryan Cleary and Jake Davis from LulzSec. Hunt observes these perpetrators are typically young, often teenagers or barely into adulthood, with limited understanding of consequences.

Referencing Parmy Olson's book "We Are Anonymous," Hunt describes the culture from which these hackers emerge—particularly 4chan communities characterized by "virtual mob rule" where shock value and reputation matter more than political conviction.

## Shift from Activism to Pranks

Hunt argues that contemporary attacks reflect less ideological motivation and more simple desire for recognition or entertainment. The cultural context these hackers inhabit has desensitized them to normal social norms, transforming otherwise "perfectly normal individuals into psychopaths" once they're behind keyboards.

## The Danger of Random Targeting

Hunt concludes by warning that indiscriminate attacks are more dangerous than politically motivated ones. When attackers target randomly rather than strategically, every website becomes vulnerable. He emphasizes: "You got a web address? Yep? You're a target. End of story."

The article ends with the observation that responses from attackers themselves—often childish taunts—confirm they derive pleasure from victims' discomfort rather than advancing any genuine cause.
