Troy Hunt announces the first full-time employee for Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), Stefán Jökull Sigurðarson, in a blog post reflecting on the service's growth since its 2013 launch as a personal project.

Hunt describes experiencing the "founder's paradox"—wanting HIBP to grow and mature while struggling to delegate control. He emphasizes that trust formed the foundation for bringing Stefán onboard, noting their connection spanning several years: from a 2018 workshop in Oslo through Stefán's work implementing Pwned Passwords at EVE Online, his role as a conference speaker and Microsoft MVP, and his volunteer contributions to open-source Pwned Passwords.

The announcement reveals Stefán previously worked part-time beginning the prior year before transitioning to full-time employment. Hunt credits the financial sustainability partly to introducing paid searches for large domains, allowing revenue reinvestment into expanding the service's infrastructure and reducing single points of failure.

Hunt notes Stefán's impressive Nordic background, mentioning discovering a video of him "swimming through a semi-frozen Norwegian fjord before riding an iceberg," which he describes as "perhaps the most Nordic thing I've ever seen." An AI-generated image replaced the video as the article's hero image.

The post underscores how Stefán's arrival represents HIBP's maturation into a sustainable operation with distributed leadership.
