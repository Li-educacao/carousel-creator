Troy Hunt argues that public shaming of organizations with poor security practices is an effective and necessary accountability tool, despite criticism that such approaches are inappropriate.

## The Pattern of Public Shaming

Hunt describes how companies make ludicrous security statements on social media, triggering public backlash. Critics then accuse those expressing outrage of inappropriate shaming tactics. However, Hunt contends this criticism misses the real-world effectiveness of public accountability.

## Real-World Examples of Change

Hunt provides several cases where public pressure drove security improvements:

**Betfair:** The company allowed password resets using only an email address and birthday—easily guessable information. After Hunt published about this vulnerability, media outlets covered the issue, and Betfair fixed the flaw. Subsequently, a Betfair security representative thanked Hunt, explaining that internal security teams couldn't convince management to act until negative publicity forced their hand.

**NatWest:** The bank initially dismissed concerns about missing HTTPS on their landing page with a dismissive response. After Hunt published a critical blog post that gained BBC attention, NatWest implemented changes within nine months. Hunt received a private message from someone at a competing bank describing similar frustration—their organization had claimed fixes would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and take a year, yet NatWest completed them overnight once media attention mounted.

**Medibank:** When Hunt tweeted about their anti-paste functionality, Medibank responded promptly and professionally, indicating they were already resolving the issue and would deploy the fix within two weeks.

## Addressing Concerns About Individual Targeting

Some argue that shaming corporate social media accounts unfairly targets individual employees. Hunt counters that these accounts are explicitly the public face of organizations. As he states, individuals managing these accounts are "the coal faces of the organisation" and represent the company in their public communications.

The responsibility falls on both the organization and its representatives. If companies empower social media managers to make public security statements, those individuals should expect accountability for those claims.

## Guidelines for Constructive Shaming

Hunt emphasizes that effective shaming requires:

- **Remaining respectful:** Feedback should be candid but not rude or abusive
- **Being factual:** Criticism should target demonstrably false claims
- **Using social pressure constructively:** Public attention motivates executive-level action in ways internal security teams cannot

## Why Private Channels Fail

Hunt notes that privately contacting organizations about security issues often yields generic responses like "we take security seriously" without meaningful action. Public shaming redirects priorities by bringing issues to executive attention through negative media coverage—something leadership takes seriously.

## The Final Point

Hunt contends that when organizations take public positions on security—either through their product design or their representatives' statements—holding them accountable is entirely reasonable. While critics might argue "the end doesn't justify the means," Hunt asserts the means themselves aren't harmful when conducted respectfully.

The evidence across multiple case studies demonstrates that public shaming, properly executed, effectively drives security improvements that internal advocacy cannot achieve.
