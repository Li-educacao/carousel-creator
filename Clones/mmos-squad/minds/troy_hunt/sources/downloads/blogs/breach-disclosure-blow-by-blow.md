Troy Hunt describes the exhausting process of disclosing data breaches to affected organizations. He explains that breach notification represents his most time-consuming activity for Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), yet receives minimal recognition for the effort.

The article recounts Hunt's experience with the Avvo data breach. After discovering the breach through a Twitter report mentioning suspicious "hacked" emails sent to Avvo-specific addresses, Hunt decided to document his entire disclosure process on camera to demonstrate the challenges involved.

Key difficulties Hunt identifies include: locating appropriate contact information at organizations, securing responses from relevant parties, and overcoming assumptions that his disclosure attempts constitute extortion attempts. He notes that these obstacles exist throughout his standard notification workflow.

Hunt ultimately succeeded in adding the Avvo breach to HIBP's searchable database. His notification efforts reached 20,183 individuals monitoring their specific accounts and an additional 9,637 people monitoring domains containing affected email addresses. He pledges to update the post if new relevant information surfaces regarding this breach.
