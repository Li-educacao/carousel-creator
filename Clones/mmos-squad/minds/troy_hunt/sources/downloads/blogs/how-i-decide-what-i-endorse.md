Troy Hunt outlines his personal framework for managing endorsements and sponsorships while maintaining credibility and transparency with his audience.

## Only Endorsing Products I'd Use Myself

Hunt explains that his best commercial relationships stem from independent product enthusiasm. He cites examples like his decade-plus use of Lenovo ThinkPads (purchased with personal funds before any partnership) and his self-funded investment in Ubiquiti networking equipment that he wrote about before any company relationship existed. As he notes, "the value the company gets out of the relationship" remains unchanged through transparent disclosure.

## Clear Financial Disclosures

When commercially incentivized, Hunt always explicitly states this. Whether writing sponsored courses or accepting free products, he ensures readers understand the financial arrangement, believing transparency enhances rather than diminishes value.

## Maintaining Independence

Hunt critiques products from companies he works with—discussing Lenovo's past Superfish vulnerability and Microsoft's security standards gaps. He emphasizes that "any sort of advocacy position is simply not a topic that's ever come up" with companies like 1Password and Freedome VPN, which he uses and recommends without financial incentive.

## Saying No

Hunt declines sponsorships misaligned with his values, rejecting companies with questionable histories or those seeking implicit endorsements in exchange for free products.

## Handling Criticism

Hunt demonstrates grace when challenged. After tweeting about Windows updates while using a Lenovo device he'd received, one follower accused him of constant promotion. Rather than defensiveness, Hunt responded with measured perspective, earning the follower's respect.
