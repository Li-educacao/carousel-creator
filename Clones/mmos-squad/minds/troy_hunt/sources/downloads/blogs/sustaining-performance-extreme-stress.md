Troy Hunt recounts navigating unprecedented stress while managing Have I Been Pwned, undergoing divorce proceedings, and purchasing a new home simultaneously. He outlines nine strategies that enabled him to maintain professional performance during this tumultuous period.

## Leaning on Friendships

Hunt emphasizes reconnecting emotionally with friends, finding that discussions about shared experiences normalized his struggles. He discovered that "friends can be that ear to talk to, shoulder to lean on" during crisis moments, reducing isolation.

## Delaying Emotional Responses

Rather than reacting immediately to triggering communications, Hunt adopted a practice of sitting with emails overnight. This approach allowed him to respond rationally rather than from anger or despair, ultimately preserving both relationships and sound decision-making.

## Maintaining Long-Term Vision

Hunt kept his future goals clearly in focus, using the "eating an elephant one bite at a time" philosophy. He broke overwhelming objectives into specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound tasks, ensuring daily progress aligned with larger aspirations.

## Dismissing Trivial Concerns

When facing contractual disputes or procedural complications, Hunt consciously chose not to escalate minor issues that wouldn't meaningfully impact outcomes, preserving mental energy for substantive matters.

## Moving Past Setbacks Quickly

Rather than dwelling on devastating outcomes, Hunt cycled through the Kübler-Ross grief model stages rapidly, recognizing that emotional intensity diminished naturally with time.

## Strategic Foresight

Hunt considered multiple decision branches ahead, mentally mapping potential responses and counter-responses to anticipate outcomes three steps forward before committing positions.

## Taking Deliberate Breaks

Hunt used leisure activities—particularly enjoying beer socially or alone—as intentional disengagement from stress, creating psychological distance from constant demands.

## Prioritizing Physical Health

Daily tennis commitments and nutritious eating (featuring poke bowls) supported mental resilience. Hunt notes exercise offers "well-documented benefits" for managing depression, anxiety, and stress.

## Establishing Consistent Routines

Weekly video updates and regular beach walks provided predictable anchors amid chaos, preventing complete dissolution of structure during his nomadic year of 243 days traveling.
