Troy Hunt examines the ethics of flagging data breaches as "sensitive" on Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), using several high-profile breaches as case studies to discuss where privacy protections should apply.

## The Ashley Madison Precedent

Hunt begins by referencing the Ashley Madison breach from over a decade ago, which exposed members of a website designed to facilitate extramarital affairs. The aftermath demonstrated troubling patterns:

- Websites were created specifically to publicly identify and shame people in the dataset
- Religious institutions contacted spouses of exposed members
- Media outlets outed notable individuals
- Radio stations encouraged listeners to search for their spouses in the breach

"People died as a result of the breach. Marriages ended and lives were turned upside down. People lost their jobs."

Witnessing this fallout, Hunt implemented HIBP's "sensitive breach" classification, preventing public searching of datasets likely to cause serious personal or social consequences.

## The Complexity of Email Addresses

Hunt emphasizes that email presence in a breach doesn't necessarily indicate guilt or actual participation. In Ashley Madison's case, multiple scenarios complicated the narrative:

- Single people who later married before the breach occurred
- Individuals attempting to catch cheating spouses by creating accounts
- Non-consensual accounts created using others' identities

This demonstrates why blanket moral judgments based on a single data point prove inadequate.

## Recent Controversies: WhiteDate and Beyond

Hunt faced criticism for flagging WhiteDate—a dating site ostensibly for white people—as sensitive. Critics argued he was protecting "Nazi hate-mongers" and compared the decision unfavorably to hypothetically breached ISIS platforms.

However, Hunt distinguishes between moral objections and legal definitions. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation identifies legally sensitive data as including information revealing "racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs; trade-union membership; genetic data; health-related data; data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation."

## Illegal Content: A Different Standard

Hunt recounts the Muah.ai breach, where an "AI girlfriend" site exposed 1.9 million email addresses. Critically, the dataset included prompts describing child exploitation. This represented actual illegal activity rather than merely controversial behavior.

In such cases, Hunt reports findings to law enforcement rather than publicly shaming individuals. He describes discovering a professionally presented LinkedIn profile matched to an email with disturbing AI prompts: "It was repulsive. Further, beyond being solely an affront to our morals, it was clearly illegal."

## The Core Principle

Hunt argues that personal moral systems cannot justify public exposure of others. He acknowledges the emotional pull of wanting to shame people whose beliefs differ from mainstream values, yet warns against HIBP becoming "a weapon to attack people solely on the basis of their email address being affiliated with a website."

The service's operational viability depends on maintaining this ethical boundary. Misusing HIBP to dox someone as a "Nazi" could trigger real-world consequences and potentially legal liability that would compromise the platform's ability to operate.

## Privacy as a Human Right

Hunt concludes by invoking Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation."

His policy remains consistent: breaches containing legally defined sensitive data remain non-searchable, and breaches containing illegal content are reported to appropriate authorities rather than weaponized for public shaming. This approach respects both individual privacy rights and the rule of law.
