Troy Hunt opens this deeply personal essay by acknowledging he lacks expertise in navigating divorce, yet chooses to share his experience because previous candid discussions about life's struggles have resonated with readers.

## Key Lessons Learned

### Nobody Cares (About the Stigma)

Hunt initially feared judgment over his marriage ending, worrying about what family and friends would think. He discovered that while loved ones care about his wellbeing and happiness, "the fact you've decided to dissolve a marriage really isn't their concern." The stigma he carried was largely self-imposed. As he normalized the experience by learning how common divorce is, he found peace.

### Everyone Has Their Own Story

Through conversations with others who'd divorced, Hunt encountered diverse narratives—some involving abuse, infidelity, addiction, or late-life realizations about sexuality. He notes that "everyone's own journey is unique" and recognizing this diversity helped him overcome the sense that his situation was exceptional or shameful.

### People Will Draw Their Own Conclusions

With mutual friends and shared social circles, Hunt initially worried about whose "side" people would take. He learned that attempting to influence perceptions backfires. Instead, avoiding discussion of the ex except when mechanically necessary proved effective. "People respond well to positivity," he observes, while judging bitterness harshly.

### Listen to Actions, Not Words

During divorce proceedings, his ex expressed desires for "an amicable outcome" and being "kind" and "considerate." His lawyer asked a pivotal question: "What do her actions tell you?" Hunt realized her stated intentions contradicted her behavior. This reframing helped him stop expecting reciprocal goodwill and instead "characterise people by their actions."

### The Rashomon Effect

Hunt discovered this concept—where witnesses to the same event report it differently—helped explain how he and his ex could have fundamentally different perceptions of what caused the marriage breakdown. Understanding this reduced his need to assign blame.

### The Root Cause Doesn't Matter

Hunt spent considerable energy analyzing what went wrong, but eventually realized "it's inconsequential." Australia's no-fault divorce laws reflect this principle—courts don't assign blame, only confirming an irretrievable breakdown exists. "Stop dwelling on it and move on," he advises, noting that replaying events only perpetuates anger and regret without changing anything.

## Navigating Parenthood

Telling their children proved emotionally devastating for Hunt beforehand. When their 9-year-old son's response to the news was requesting pizza for dinner, Hunt found relief in this perspective shift: children care about being loved and supported, not the social concept of marriage failure.

However, he emphasizes the danger of "loyalty binds"—when children feel forced to choose sides or fear losing a parent. He stresses that adults must manage emotions around divorce to protect children from this burden, noting that exposing kids to negativity about the other parent is "a selfish act that prioritises your emotions over the kids' wellbeing."

## Professional Support

Hunt credits his psychologist, Clive, with transforming his perspective. One particularly useful metaphor: think of troubling communications "as a drunk person in a pub throwing punches at you. It's demanding your attention, but nothing is connecting."

More importantly, Clive's repeated counsel to "follow the process" reframed divorce as a series of business negotiations wrapped in emotion. Rather than viewing the entire situation as overwhelming, breaking it into sequential steps—"follow the process and sustain performance"—made it manageable.

Clive also mapped Hunt's emotional journey against the Kübler-Ross grief stages, showing him he was progressing toward "engaging and embracing new normal."

## It Gets Better

Hunt notes that everyone who'd completed divorce told him the same thing: circumstances improve. Every friend he mentioned eventually found new partners and happiness. He himself became engaged on New Year's Day and married in September, describing life as "never been better."

He closes with a Lao Tzu quote: "If you are at peace you are living in the present," noting that while occasional anxiety remains, it's increasingly fleeting.
