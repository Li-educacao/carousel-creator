Troy Hunt announced the release of his book, "Pwned: The Collected Blog Posts of Troy Hunt," which compiles personal stories and reflections from his cybersecurity career.

## Background

Hunt first announced the project in April 2021, after investing significant effort with co-authors Rob Conery and Charlotte. A preview version released in October 2021, but Hunt delayed the full release to ensure quality standards. He completely rewrote the introduction, reorganized selected posts, and edited personal content throughout.

## Book Features

The final publication includes:
- Rewritten introductory material by Rob Conery
- Personally reflective epilogue contributions from both Hunt and Charlotte
- Editorial retrospectives providing present-day context for older posts
- Stories examining his career challenges, including security vulnerability disclosures, the Have I Been Pwned sale process, and dealing with online abuse

## Publication Timing

Hunt deliberately released the book before his wedding to share personal stories from earlier life phases. He described the epilogue sections as "very personal," reflecting what felt natural to both authors at that specific moment.

## Reader Feedback

Preview readers praised the book's emotional authenticity and accessibility. One reviewer noted: "you've been taken on a journey with Troy through the years," while another appreciated discovering "so much heart on display."

The book is available at book.troyhunt.com.
