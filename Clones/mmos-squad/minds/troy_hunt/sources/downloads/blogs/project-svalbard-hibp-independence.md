Troy Hunt announced that Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) will remain independently operated after an attempted acquisition process called Project Svalbard concluded without a sale.

## The Outcome

Hunt spent 11 months pursuing a potential sale of HIBP through KPMG's merger and acquisition process. After engaging with 141 companies globally and narrowing to 43 serious contenders, exclusivity was granted to a single bidder in September 2019. However, unexpected business model changes at the acquiring company rendered the deal "infeasible," leading both parties to abandon negotiations.

## The Process

Hunt described the experience as emotionally taxing. The intensive due diligence phase included thousands of requests for documentation, from board meeting minutes to disaster recovery procedures—tasks challenging for a single-operator service. The bidding companies valued not just HIBP itself, but Hunt's personal credibility and trustworthiness within the security community, essentially putting a dollar figure on his reputation.

## What Changed

During the 11-month process, Hunt onboarded five new governments to HIBP, loaded 77 new breaches containing 1.7 billion records, and implemented an authenticated API with payment processing. He also earned recognition in the Infosecurity Hall of Fame and maintained his regular speaking schedule.

## Moving Forward

Rather than restarting the M&A process with remaining bidders, Hunt decided to recover and operate HIBP independently. He plans to delegate more work, explore government relationships, and pursue industry-wide initiatives for tackling data breaches more effectively.
