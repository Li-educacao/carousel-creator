Troy Hunt describes his systematic approach to notifying organizations about data breaches before publicly disclosing them through Have I Been Pwned (HIBP). He acknowledges the challenge of managing hundreds of gigabytes of unprocessed breach data and seeks community feedback on his disclosure methodology.

Hunt establishes five escalation levels for contacting organizations:

**Level 1** involves searching for published security contact information, including security.txt files, vulnerability reporting policies, or dedicated security email addresses.

**Level 2** focuses on general contact channels: contact forms, publicized emails, social media accounts, and standard addresses like security@, admin@, and support@. Hunt allows three business days for responses before escalating.

**Level 3** pursues indirect contact through WHOIS records, LinkedIn employee searches, OSINT research, and existing breach database contacts. This optional level also permits three business days for replies.

**Level 4** involves public social media requests seeking security contacts, with a 24-hour window before final escalation.

**Level 5** results in full public disclosure through HIBP after reasonable contact attempts have failed.

Hunt applies this framework to three breach disclosures: The Fly on the Wall (84,000 records), Open CS:GO (512,000 records), and Lyrics Mania (109,000 records). In each case, organizations failed to respond despite attempts across multiple channels, leading to HIBP publication and subscriber notifications.

He emphasizes that "reasonable attempts" to notify organizations before disclosure are essential, particularly given potential regulatory consequences like the $650,000 FTC fine imposed on VTech.
