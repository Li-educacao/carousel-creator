The central tension this article explores is whether breached organizations should notify affected individuals about data exposure, particularly when legal requirements don't mandate disclosure.

Troy Hunt begins by clarifying a widespread misconception about disclosure obligations. Under UK GDPR, organizations must report "certain" breaches to regulators within 72 hours, but notifying individuals only becomes mandatory when the breach presents "a high risk of adversely affecting individuals' rights and freedoms." Australia has similar carveouts based on "serious harm." This means many organizations can legally avoid notifying customers.

Hunt illustrates this with the Deezer case: a 2019 breach exposing 229 million records (names, emails, dates of birth, IP addresses) remained undisclosed to customers for months. Despite GDPR applicability, Deezer claimed no legal violation occurred. Only after public backlash, amplified by Have I Been Pwned notifications and social media, did they eventually notify individuals — nearly two months later.

## Key Arguments for Disclosure

Hunt presents several compelling reasons organizations should disclose regardless of legal requirements:

**Data Ownership and Trust:** Personal information belongs to individuals who entrusted organizations with it. Organizations claiming data ownership lack "commonsense" moral standing with affected people.

**Harm Assessment Complexity:** Organizations cannot determine whether exposure causes "serious harm" to each individual. Someone's email-name association might endanger those maintaining separate online identities. Even seemingly benign data (email addresses alone) enables sophisticated phishing attacks leveraging accurate personal details.

**Who Non-Disclosure Actually Protects:** Contrary to company claims about protecting customers, suppression primarily shields corporate reputation and shareholder interests, not individual welfare.

**Information Vacuum:** When organizations stay silent, hackers, journalists, and bad actors fill the narrative void with inaccurate accounts. Public disclosure allows breached organizations to control messaging.

**Inevitable Disclosure:** Hunt invokes his 2017 "Five Stages of Data Breach Grief" concept, suggesting truth eventually emerges. Organizations delaying disclosure face prolonged uncertainty, and late revelation damages credibility far more than prompt acknowledgment.

**Backlash Risk:** Hunt notes a 2017 shift in public judgment — people evaluate organizations not for being breached but for breach response quality. Uber's attempt to conceal its breach and pay hackers for silence resulted in reputational devastation and criminal convictions for its Chief Security Officer.

**Basic Decency:** Hunt appeals to fundamental ethics: if you lose customer data, acknowledge it. This reflects customer expectations and increasingly reflects government positions.

He concludes with a 2024 quote from Australian Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neill: "The people whose data has been stolen are the real victims here. If you focus on them and put their interests first every single day, you will get good outcomes."

Hunt emphasizes that global government and law enforcement agencies now view victim notification as essential cybersecurity infrastructure, and he commits to pushing for mandatory notification across all data breach incidents.
