Troy Hunt reflects on ten years of running Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), the data breach search service launched on December 4, 2013. What began as a casual pet project has evolved into a globally recognized cybersecurity resource.

## Origin and Naming

The service's unusual name stemmed from practical necessity. Hunt struggled to secure a standard domain name and didn't anticipate the project's longevity. He notes: "I honestly didn't expect this thing to go anywhere." The term "pwned," derived from gaming culture, has become intrinsically linked with HIBP, with some online sources now referencing the site when defining the word itself.

The quirky name generated numerous domain variations, including haveibeenprawned.com (after a journalist mispronounced it on air) and haveibeenfucked.com (suggested humorously by internet users).

## Media and Public Recognition

HIBP gained substantial press coverage tied to major data breaches. The service has been featured in The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, TIME magazine, and numerous international publications. TIME named it "one of the 50 best websites of 2014," while Gizmodo later ranked it among the top 100 websites shaping the internet.

High-profile media appearances created unexpected consequences—the Martin Lewis Money Show inadvertently caused a denial-of-service event in 2016, overwhelming the service with traffic.

## Congressional Testimony

In 2017, Hunt testified before the U.S. Congress regarding data breaches and identity verification impacts. He describes this experience as "one of the most memorable moments of my career," surreal given his initial skepticism about the project's viability.

## Project Svalbard and Personal Challenges

In 2019, Hunt announced plans to sell HIBP, revealing considerable personal stress. He later disclosed that divorce proceedings significantly influenced this decision. The attempted sale, codenamed "Project Svalbard," ultimately fell through after a potential acquirer withdrew. Hunt reflects that "I've never been so happy to have lost so much," recognizing that independence mattered more than financial gain.

A pivotal moment occurred during buyer meetings in California when an interviewer asked about his ideal workday. Hunt realized: "I get on my jet ski and I do whatever the fuck I want"—a realization that financial security couldn't replicate.

## Law Enforcement Partnerships

Unexpectedly, HIBP became integrated with law enforcement agencies. The FBI began feeding data into the service, as did the UK's National Crime Agency and other international agencies. Hunt acknowledges the alignment between HIBP's mission—"to do good things after bad things happen"—and law enforcement objectives. These partnerships evolved into genuine professional relationships.

## Pwned Passwords

Launched in 2017, the Pwned Passwords service indexes compromised passwords without associated personally identifiable information. Despite initial hesitation about including passwords, Hunt recognized their value for security purposes. The service processes billions of requests monthly—reaching 6 billion requests in a rolling 30-day period by September 2023, with 100% served from Cloudflare's cache.

## Notable Breaches

Over 731 breaches have been indexed. Significant incidents include:

- **Ashley Madison (2015):** Had profound emotional impact as Hunt engaged with affected members
- **Collection #1 (2019):** The largest breach indexed, containing 773 million records, significantly contributed to stress leading to the sale attempt
- **Humorous breaches:** Rosebutt and Shit Express demonstrated that even serious incidents can contain moments of levity

## Team Development

For years, Hunt operated HIBP solo. Recently, he brought on Charlotte Hunt (his wife) to handle business operations, subscriber management, and administrative functions. Stefán Jökull Sigurðarson joined part-time as a developer, bringing coding expertise and genuine passion for the mission.

Hunt emphasizes that adding team members occurred incrementally and only with people very close to him, reflecting his desire to maintain control and avoid corporate management responsibilities.

## Privacy and Legal Paradoxes

Hunt addresses the apparent contradiction of handling stolen data while serving the public good. He notes that occasional complaints from internet users claiming he violates privacy regulations rarely materialize into formal action. Only one government privacy regulator has lodged a complaint during HIBP's decade of operation, which was resolved through respectful dialogue.

## Future Direction

Hunt envisions gradual, incremental improvements rather than rapid expansion. He wants HIBP to outlive him without becoming an oppressive burden. Future considerations include better indexing of ransomware-related data dumps, though he maintains his characteristic flexibility: "I'll work it out on the morning" of each new day.

The article concludes with Hunt's recognition that his journey from launching a quirky side project to testifying before Congress remains genuinely surprising—even to him.
