Troy Hunt discusses systemic problems in how data breaches are handled, disclosed, and litigated in modern cybersecurity.

## Breach Disclosure Remains Challenging

Notifying companies about breaches they may not know occurred is extraordinarily difficult. Hunt explains that while breaches circulate on hacking forums, victims often remain unaware. Contact information is frequently obscured or ineffective—emails get lost in spam filters meant for sales inquiries.

The `security.txt` standard offers promise but faces practical obstacles. Hunt notes: "When a firm uses one, they get bombarded with beg bounties and legitimate reports get lost in all the junk." In his experience, only one company he disclosed to had implemented this file.

Communication quality varies dramatically. About half of organizations respond cooperatively and recognize Have I Been Pwned (HIBP). The other half respond with hostility, sometimes involving lawyers before understanding what disclosure means.

## Notification Failures

Many organizations deliberately avoid notifying customers about breaches. One firm admitted it wouldn't notify people because the incident occurred more than six months prior. Another organization indicated they'd only notify "where legally obligated," explicitly avoiding moral responsibility.

Critically, regulatory frameworks often require notifying authorities but not individuals. Hunt stresses that most people overestimate legal protections: "No, you almost certainly don't... but you should."

## Corporate Priorities Misaligned

Companies prioritize reputation management over victim protection. Hunt recounts: "Mate, it's a room full of lawyers working out how to spin this"—describing a situation where millions of records were already exposed while executives delayed response.

CEOs sometimes blame reporters for coverage rather than focusing on remediation, despite Hunt conducting professional disclosures.

## Class Action Complications

Litigation creates perverse incentives. Most victims struggle to demonstrate concrete harm—some breaches require license renewal that would happen anyway. Lawyers actively recruit through HIBP itself.

Hunt acknowledges: "I don't care about lawyers doing lawyer things. But I do care about the adverse consequences it has on the corporate victims."

## Path Forward

Hunt proposes mandatory individual notification (separate from regulatory notification), legal protections for companies demonstrating good-faith security practices, and elimination of frivolous suits lacking demonstrated harm.

However, he remains pessimistic: "I don't see anything changing any time soon, and anecdotally, it's worse now than it was 5 or 10 years ago."

The proliferation of third-party dependencies increases vulnerability points while companies deflect accountability, worsening an already fractured system.
