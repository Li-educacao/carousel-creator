## Self-Identification

"My name is Troy Hunt. I am an Australian security researcher, I guess."
"I run the data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned?"

→ Note the hedging "I guess" and the question mark inflection — humility/imposter syndrome signal.

## Scale of HIBP

"I remember when I started it. It was like 155 million records in there."
"It's almost 6.9 billion records" (after loading Dubsmash data)
"My own e-mail address has been seen fifteen times."

→ Uses personal vulnerability as teaching tool.

## Emotional Toll / Mental Health

"At the moment it is wearing me out because it's so much work."
"I actually started to become really conscious of the mental toll it's taking."

→ CRITICAL for Layer 7 (obsessions) and Layer 8 (paradoxes): the person who helps millions cope with breaches struggles with the weight of that responsibility.

## On Password Reuse

"Well, the only way that really makes sense is if you're using that same password everywhere."

→ Direct, simplifying complex concepts to core truth.

## On Regulation vs Civil Penalties

"I'm more supportive of regulatory penalties where we have someone like the FTC...I'm more supportive of that."
"I'd like to say it happened a lot more" (regarding FTC enforcement).

→ Pragmatic stance: prefers regulatory enforcement over civil lawsuits.

## RockYou's Lasting Impact

"RockYou has sort of been one of those canonical sets of data...The long-term value of RockYou is still there."
"People are still using the same sorts of passwords that they were back then."

→ Long-term pattern recognition; cynical realism about human behavior not changing.
