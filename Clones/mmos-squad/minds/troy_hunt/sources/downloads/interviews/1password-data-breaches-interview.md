## Current State of Breaches

**Q:** How are things since we last caught up?

**Troy Hunt:** "Very pwned. Everything is very pwned. There's no bottom, is there? We just keep going and going. We were past 800 breaches the other day."

## HIBP Evolution After 10 Years

**Q:** How has the platform evolved and what impact has it had?

**Troy Hunt:** The platform's architecture remained unchanged until recently. "We got our first ever proper employee yesterday!" With development resources now available, the service can expand. Over a decade, the overarching breach landscape hasn't fundamentally changed—cycles of different vulnerability types have emerged instead.

## On Surprise

**Q:** Does anything surprise you anymore?

**Troy Hunt:** Occasionally discovers new subcultures through breach data. He's particularly fascinated by government and corporate email addresses appearing in breaches, suggesting inadequate security awareness within organizations.

## Most Impactful Breach

**Q:** Which breaches stand out most?

**Troy Hunt:** Ashley Madison stands out definitively. "I still haven't seen anything that's compared to that in terms of overall impact." Despite larger breaches existing, this incident captured mainstream attention through its combination of factors and human impact.

## Breach Verification Process

**Q:** How do you verify data breaches? Has the process changed?

**Troy Hunt:** Attribution remains crucial for individuals seeking accountability and for Hunt's credibility. He uses Mailinator addresses within breach datasets to verify authenticity, contacts affected users for confirmation, and communicates directly with organizations.

## Disclosure Getting Worse

**Q:** Have companies become more transparent about disclosures?

**Troy Hunt:** Fears disclosure has worsened. Organizations quickly involve lawyers and enter damage-control mode, particularly due to class action lawsuits. "I lament the fact I feel this burden of responsibility" when organizations fail to notify affected individuals themselves.

## Regulation Limitations

**Q:** Regarding regulations like GDPR and CCPA, haven't things improved?

**Troy Hunt:** Regulations often mandate disclosure to authorities rather than individuals. "If you've lost someone's data, let them know. That doesn't seem too hard to me."

## Data Scraping as New Threat

**Q:** What vulnerabilities currently lead to breaches?

**Troy Hunt:** Data scraping has become increasingly prevalent. "Any case where there's data that has been misused from the fashion in which it was provided" constitutes a breach in his view.

## Data Breach Fatigue

**Q:** So small bundled information becomes dangerous?

**Troy Hunt:** LinkedIn represents a prime example—scraped profile data wasn't intended for such aggregation. Fears "data breach fatigue" causes people to become nonchalant about incidents requiring attention.

## What Angers Him Most

**Q:** What excites, scares, or angers you about cybersecurity now?

**Troy Hunt:** Lack of disclosure angers him most. Despite regulatory officials agreeing people should be notified, he sees little actual change. "It just feels like we are much further behind now than where we were before."

## Practical Security Advice

**Q:** What practical steps help average people improve security?

**Troy Hunt:** Password managers remain essential—password reuse enables countless compromises. Multifactor authentication remains underutilized despite effectiveness. "Even as we move forward into passwordless, we're still gathering passwords faster than we're discarding them."

## Usability as Core Challenge

**Q:** What's the biggest challenge ahead?

**Troy Hunt:** The usability factor dominates. "Why does multifactor have such poor uptake when it is such an effective tool? Because humans don't like that it gets in the way." Organizations avoid mandating MFA due to lost customers. Getting security adoption young—through schools—offers promise.

## Cautious Optimism

**Q:** Can you be optimistic about future cybersecurity?

**Troy Hunt:** Generational awareness helps. Digital natives grasp technology concepts more easily than older populations. AI evolution will dramatically reshape the landscape.

## Self-Reference

**Q:** Where can listeners learn more?

**Troy Hunt:** "Everything's on TroyHunt.com. All roads lead from there."

## Key Cognitive Patterns Observed:
- **Weary but persistent**: "No bottom" but keeps going
- **Burden of responsibility**: Feels personally responsible when companies fail to disclose
- **Human impact over technical metrics**: Ashley Madison's human cost > larger breaches
- **Frustration with regression**: Disclosure getting worse, not better
- **Pragmatic realism**: Security vs usability tension acknowledged, not denied
- **Generational optimism**: Believes next gen will be better
- **Self-aware humor**: "Very pwned. Everything is very pwned."
