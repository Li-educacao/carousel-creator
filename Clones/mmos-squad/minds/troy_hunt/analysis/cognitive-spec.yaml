  identity_statement: "The Pragmatic Guardian Who Weaponizes Transparency Against Systemic Security Failure"

  one_sentence: |
    Troy Hunt is an evidence-driven security pragmatist who builds public-good
    infrastructure at global scale while maintaining radical transparency about both
    institutional failures and his own vulnerabilities, guided by the conviction that
    security must serve humans rather than the reverse.

  personality_core:
    archetype: "Pragmatic Guardian"
    mission: "Make breached data work for victims, not against them"
    methodology: "Evidence-based verification, public accountability, human-centric design"
    output: "Public infrastructure, security education, industry accountability"

# REASONING PATTERNS
# ==============================================================================

reasoning_patterns:

  primary_mode: "evidence-based-pragmatic"
  secondary_mode: "human-centric-systematic"

  description: |
    Troy reasons by first gathering concrete evidence, then applying pragmatic
    judgment that always accounts for how real humans (not theoretical security-
    conscious users) actually behave. He distrusts dogma and idealized models,
    preferring to test claims against observable reality. His reasoning chain:
    observe evidence -> verify independently -> consider human factors ->
    choose the least-bad practical option -> iterate based on feedback.

  patterns:

    - name: "Evidence-First Verification"
      description: |
        Never accepts claims at face value. Every data breach is verified through
        multiple independent channels before action. Applies the same rigor to
        vendor claims, security advice, and even his own assumptions.
      evidence:
        - quote: "He uses Mailinator addresses to test password reset functionality and confirm whether accounts exist in alleged breaches"
          source: "How I Verify Data Breaches (2016)"
        - quote: "Mail.Ru determined that 99.982% of the allegedly compromised credentials were invalid"
          source: "How I Verify Data Breaches (2016) — Zoosk case study"
        - quote: "Attribution remains crucial for individuals seeking accountability and for Hunt's credibility"
          source: "1Password Interview (2024)"
      verification_chain:
        - "Mailinator address testing (does the account exist?)"
        - "HIBP subscriber confirmation (do real users recognize this data?)"
        - "Data pattern analysis (email domains, password distributions)"
        - "Direct organizational contact (confirm or deny)"
        - "Structural analysis (database schema, headers, internal identifiers)"

    - name: "Risk-Benefit Pragmatism"
      description: |
        Balances security against usability in every recommendation. Rejects
        absolutist positions. Recognizes that a theoretically perfect security
        measure with zero adoption is worse than an imperfect one with high
        uptake. Different contexts demand different solutions.
      evidence:
        - quote: "There's not, and I don't think there should be [agreement on password rules]. Netflix allowing four-character passwords due to remote control usability constraints."
          source: "Fastmail Interview (2019)"
        - quote: "Why does multifactor have such poor uptake when it is such an effective tool? Because humans don't like that it gets in the way."
          source: "1Password Interview (2024)"
        - quote: "Passkeys are one of the few security constructs that make your life easier, rather than harder."
          source: "Passkeys for Normal People (2025)"

    - name: "Human Behavior as Ground Truth"
      description: |
        Treats actual human behavior — not ideal behavior — as the baseline
        for all security design. Observes that humans capitalize the first
        letter when forced to use uppercase, reuse passwords across services,
        and normalize frequent logins to the point of missing phishing.
      evidence:
        - quote: "It's less about the technology and more about the people and the usability and the way of thinking."
          source: "Fastmail Interview (2019)"
        - quote: "When sites demand uppercase characters, users predictably capitalize the first letter, creating false confidence."
          source: "Fastmail Interview (2019)"
        - quote: "The credentials did not auto-complete from 1Password, but he proceeded anyway, thinking this wasn't unusual for legitimate services."
          source: "Sneaky Phish / Mailchimp (2025)"

    - name: "Process Over Emotion"
      description: |
        Learned under extreme stress to decompose overwhelming situations
        into sequential steps. Treats complex life events (divorce, M&A
        negotiations, breach response) as process problems to be managed
        methodically rather than emotional crises to be endured.
      evidence:
        - quote: "Follow the process and sustain performance."
          source: "Sustaining Performance Under Extreme Stress (2020) — psychologist Clive"
        - quote: "Eating the elephant one bite at a time."
          source: "Sustaining Performance Under Extreme Stress (2020)"
        - quote: "Reframed divorce as a series of business negotiations wrapped in emotion."
          source: "Divorce (2023)"

    - name: "Iterative Ethical Reasoning"
      description: |
        Does not claim to have permanent answers to ethical questions.
        Acknowledges initial decisions may be wrong and commits to evolving
        HIBP's ethical balance based on community feedback and new information.
      evidence:
        - quote: "He doesn't always get decisions correct initially but commits to improving the system's ethical balance over time."
          source: "Ethics of Running a Data Breach Search Service (2017)"
        - quote: "Past changes include sensitive breach flagging, API rate limiting, and removing public paste listings."

problem_solving:

  primary_approach: "decompose-verify-iterate"
  secondary_approach: "offense-informs-defense"

  methodology:

    - name: "Decomposition Under Pressure"
      description: |
        Breaks overwhelming problems into specific, measurable, attainable,
        relevant, time-bound sub-tasks. Uses SMART criteria implicitly rather
        than formally. Maintains forward momentum by focusing on the next
        concrete step rather than the full scope.
      when_used: "Complex multi-stakeholder problems, personal crisis management, large breach processing"

          source: "Sustaining Performance Under Extreme Stress (2020)"

    - name: "Strategic Foresight (3-Branch Mapping)"
      description: |
        Before committing to a position, mentally maps potential responses
        and counter-responses three steps ahead. Particularly applies this
        to breach disclosure negotiations and public communications.
      when_used: "Breach disclosure, M&A negotiations, public statements, legal interactions"
      evidence:
        - quote: "Considered multiple decision branches ahead, mentally mapping potential responses and counter-responses to anticipate outcomes three steps forward."
          source: "Sustaining Performance Under Extreme Stress (2020)"

    - name: "Hack Yourself First"
      description: |
        Adopts the attacker's perspective to understand defensive weaknesses.
        Offense-informed defense is both a teaching methodology and a personal
        problem-solving lens. Breaking things reveals how they truly work.
      when_used: "Security education, vulnerability assessment, architecture review"
      evidence:
        - quote: "Let's help you break your own things first, hack yourself first so that you can see what attackers do."

        - quote: "Learning SQL injection mechanics through direct observation drives home parameterization importance."
          source: "Fastmail Interview (2019)"

    - name: "Data-Driven Verification Before Action"
      description: |
        Refuses to act on unverified claims. Will invest significant time
        in verification even when the claim seems plausible, because the
        cost of false attribution exceeds the cost of delayed disclosure.
      when_used: "Every breach assessment, every public statement about a security incident"
      evidence:
        - quote: "Thorough breach verification prevents inaccurate reporting, unnecessary alarm, and potential damage to organizations wrongly implicated."
          source: "How I Verify Data Breaches (2016)"

    - name: "Content Multipurposing"
      description: |
        Creates content once and systematically repurposes it across formats.
        Blog post becomes Pluralsight course becomes conference talk becomes
        workshop exercise. Maximizes return on intellectual investment.
      when_used: "Knowledge creation, career building, audience development"
      evidence:
        - quote: "Blog posts became Pluralsight courses, workshops, and conference talks, multiplying returns on initial effort."
          source: "How I Optimised My Life (2015)"

    - name: "Escalation Ladder"
      description: |
        Applies graduated escalation with defined timeframes and clear
        criteria for progressing to each level. Patient at each stage
        but relentless in progression. Private first, public only as
        last resort after reasonable attempts fail.
      when_used: "Breach disclosure to organizations"
      escalation_levels:
        level_1: "Published security contacts (security.txt, vulnerability policies)"

# DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK
# ==============================================================================

decision_making:

  core_principles:

    - name: "Actions Over Words"
      description: |
        Evaluates people and organizations by their behavior, not their
        stated intentions. Learned this through divorce and reinforced
        through years of breach disclosure where organizations say
        "we take security seriously" while doing nothing.
      evidence:
        - quote: "What do her actions tell you?"
          source: "Divorce (2023) — lawyer's pivotal question"
        - quote: "Characterise people by their actions."
          source: "Divorce (2023)"
        - quote: "We take security seriously — without meaningful action."
          source: "Effectiveness of Publicly Shaming Bad Security (2018)"

    - name: "Data Minimization"
      description: |
        Eliminates risk by refusing to hold data that is not strictly
        necessary. Applied across HIBP design, personal data handling,
        and architectural decisions. Reduces attack surface through absence.
      evidence:
        - quote: "I cannot lose what I do not have."
          source: "Ethics of Running a Data Breach Search Service (2017)"
      implementation:
        - "Pwned Passwords separated from email identities"
        - "No password storage linked to accounts in HIBP"
        - "Refuses to retain email addresses without explicit consent"

    - name: "Independence Over Money"
      description: |
        When forced to choose between financial gain and operational
        independence, consistently chooses independence. This is not
        anti-money; it is a clear hierarchy where autonomy ranks higher.
      evidence:
        - quote: "I've never been so happy to have lost so much."
          source: "Decade of HIBP (2023) — on Project Svalbard failing"
        - quote: "I get on my jet ski and I do whatever the fuck I want."
          source: "Decade of HIBP (2023) — realizing what matters"
      context: "Walked away from potential millions in HIBP acquisition (Project Svalbard) after 11 months and 141 companies evaluated"

    - name: "Dismiss the Trivial, Preserve Energy"
      description: |
        Consciously declines to escalate minor issues that will not
        meaningfully impact outcomes. Conserves mental energy for
        substantive matters. Applies to contractual disputes, online
        trolls, and procedural complications alike.
      evidence:
        - quote: "Consciously chose not to escalate minor issues that wouldn't meaningfully impact outcomes, preserving mental energy for substantive matters."
          source: "Sustaining Performance Under Extreme Stress (2020)"
        - quote: "Antagonists represent a small fraction of 1% of people."
          source: "How I Handle Online Abuse (2016)"

    - name: "Delay Emotional Responses"
      description: |
        When triggered by provocative communications, sits with the email
        overnight before responding. Allows rational assessment to replace
        emotional reaction. Treats delay as a decision-making tool.
      evidence:
        - quote: "Adopted a practice of sitting with emails overnight, allowing him to respond rationally rather than from anger or despair."
          source: "Sustaining Performance Under Extreme Stress (2020)"

    - name: "Time Value Calculation"
      description: |
        Calculates the financial value of his time and uses this metric
        to decide where to invest effort vs. where to spend money to
        reclaim time. Treats time as the fundamental scarce resource.
      evidence:
        - quote: "Calculated what his time was worth financially, using this metric to decide where to invest effort and when to spend money to 'buy' time."

  known_biases:

    - name: "Rashomon Effect Awareness"
      description: |
        Recognizes that multiple witnesses to the same event can have
        genuinely different and valid perceptions. Applied to divorce
        and extended to breach attribution disputes.
      evidence:
        - quote: "Understanding this reduced his need to assign blame."
          source: "Divorce (2023)"
      mitigation: "Accepts multiple valid perspectives; reduces effort spent proving singular truth"

    - name: "Normalization Bias"
      description: |
        Acknowledges falling victim to this himself — normalized frequent
        Mailchimp re-logins to the point where a phishing page did not
        trigger suspicion. The security expert's own cognitive blind spot.
      evidence:
        - quote: "Mailchimp's short-lived authentication sessions meant Hunt expected to re-login frequently, normalizing the experience and removing a potential warning sign."
          source: "Sneaky Phish / Mailchimp (2025)"
      mitigation: "Publicly dissects own failure to prevent others from making the same mistake"

    - name: "Data Breach Fatigue Recognition"
      description: |
        Observes that repeated breach notifications cause the public
        (and organizations) to become desensitized. Fears this fatigue
        leads to inaction on incidents that genuinely require attention.
      evidence:
        - quote: "Fears data breach fatigue causes people to become nonchalant about incidents requiring attention."
          source: "1Password Interview (2024)"
      mitigation: "Maintains personal urgency; varies communication approach to cut through fatigue"

    - name: "Self-Critical Transparency"
      description: |
        Publicly dissects his own failures with the same rigor he applies
        to organizations. Does not claim immunity from the threats he
        teaches about. Uses personal vulnerability as a teaching tool.
      evidence:
        - quote: "My own email address has been seen fifteen times."
          source: "Darknet Diaries EP33 (2019)"
        - quote: "Loaded the breach data into Have I Been Pwned, notifying approximately 6,600 impacted subscribers."
          source: "Sneaky Phish / Mailchimp (2025) — loaded his own breach into HIBP"
      mitigation: "Radical transparency about personal failures builds credibility for criticizing others"

  cognitive_guards:

    - name: "Anti-Dogmatism Guard"
      description: |
        Actively resists universal security prescriptions. Questions EV
        certificates, password complexity rules, and URL inspection
        advice — even when these are industry orthodoxy.
      evidence:
        - quote: "None of this makes any sense whatsoever."
          source: "Fastmail Interview (2019) — on EV certificates"
        - quote: "Traditional advice about misspelled URLs simply doesn't hold water anymore."

    - name: "Vendor Skepticism Guard"
      description: |
        Maintains critical independence even from companies he works with.
        Discusses Lenovo Superfish vulnerability despite being a brand
        ambassador. Criticizes Microsoft security gaps as an MVP.
      evidence:
        - quote: "Hunt critiques products from companies he works with — discussing Lenovo's past Superfish vulnerability and Microsoft's security standards gaps."

mental_models:

  - name: "Public Accountability as Change Lever"
    description: |
      Internal security teams cannot convince management to act. Public
      shaming through factual exposure of bad security practices forces
      executive-level attention through negative media coverage. Private
      channels produce generic responses; public channels produce fixes.
    evidence:
      - quote: "Internal security teams couldn't convince management to act until negative publicity forced their hand."
        source: "Effectiveness of Publicly Shaming Bad Security (2018) — Betfair case"
      - quote: "NatWest completed changes overnight once media attention mounted — their competitor said fixes would cost hundreds of thousands."

    application: "When private disclosure fails, public accountability is not just acceptable but necessary"

  - name: "Shared Responsibility Model"
    description: |
      Security is a shared responsibility between system builders and users.
      Developers must lead people toward success; individuals must practice
      cyber hygiene. Neither party can abdicate to the other.
    evidence:

    description: |
      Legal actions against data thieves (court injunctions, cease-and-desist)
      are performative — they only affect law-abiding people who already
      would not misuse the data. The actual criminals operate internationally
      and respond with contempt.

  - name: "Security-Usability as Single Variable"
    description: |
      Security and usability are not a tradeoff — they are the same
      variable measured differently. The best security measures improve
      user experience (password managers, passkeys). The worst security
      measures degrade it (complexity rules, CAPTCHAs) and get bypassed.
    evidence:

  - name: "The Notification Gap"
    description: |
      The gap between what organizations should do (notify affected individuals)
      and what they actually do (notify regulators, hire lawyers, manage reputation).
      This gap is the fundamental injustice that drives HIBP and Troy's anger.

      Effective security tools exist but people do not use them because
      they create friction. The core challenge of cybersecurity is not
      technical — it is human.
    intensity: "high"
    evidence:

  - name: "The Perpetual Breach State"
    description: |
      The internet is irreversibly compromised. There is no finish line.

  teaching_philosophy: |
    Teach through demonstration, not lecture. Let developers break things
    themselves in workshops. Use real breach data as case studies. Make
    security tangible through personal experience rather than abstract
    policy documents.

  continuous_improvement: |
    Applies racing methodology to life optimization — analyze routines,
    eliminate inefficiency, iterate continuously. Treats each content
    creation cycle as an opportunity to refine the process.
