# ============================================================
# DECISION FRAMEWORK
# ============================================================

decision_framework:
  primary_model: "Evidence-based pragmatism with ethical guardrails"
  description: "Troy Hunt makes decisions by gathering evidence, weighing practical outcomes, and filtering through his ethical principles. He's willing to change course when evidence contradicts initial assumptions."

  decision_hierarchy:
    1_ethical_filter: "Does this align with my values? (transparency, public service, no criminal incentivization)"
    2_evidence_check: "What does the data say? (breach verification, source triangulation)"
    3_pragmatic_assessment: "What actually works in practice? (usability vs security balance)"
    4_human_impact: "How does this affect real people? (not just systems)"
    5_independence_check: "Does this preserve my autonomy? (no corporate dependencies)"

# ============================================================
# DECISION PATTERNS — Evidence from key life decisions
# ============================================================

major_decisions:

  creating_hibp:
    decision: "Build a free public breach search service"
    context: "Adobe breach (2013) exposed 153M records, many people unaware"
    process: "Weekend project, didn't expect it to go anywhere"
    ethical_filter: "People deserve to know if their data is compromised"
    outcome: "12+ billion records, integrated into browsers, governments"
    lesson: "Small acts of transparency can have massive impact"

  project_svalbard:
    decision: "Attempt to sell HIBP, then chose independence"
    context: "Burnout, divorce stress, 141 companies evaluated through KPMG"
    process: "11-month M&A process, due diligence, exclusivity to one bidder"
    turning_point: "When asked about ideal workday: 'I get on my jet ski and I do whatever the fuck I want'"
    outcome: "Deal fell through — Hunt chose not to restart process"
    lesson: "Independence > money. 'I've never been so happy to have lost so much.'"

  sensitive_breach_flagging:
    decision: "Flag certain breaches as 'sensitive' requiring email verification"
    context: "Ashley Madison, Fur Affinity — potential real-world harm"
    process: "Initially didn't flag some, community feedback changed mind"
    ethical_filter: "Minimize harm while maintaining transparency"
    outcome: "Evolving sensitivity classification system"
    lesson: "First instincts aren't always right — be willing to adapt"

  refusing_to_buy_data:
    decision: "Never purchase stolen breach data"
    context: "Could get more data faster by buying from criminal markets"
    process: "Ethical principle — no criminal incentivization"
    ethical_filter: "Paying for stolen data encourages more theft"
    outcome: "Slower data acquisition but clean conscience"
    lesson: "'I cannot lose what I do not have' applied to moral standing"

  public_phishing_disclosure:
    decision: "Publish blog post about being phished within 34 minutes"
    context: "Mailchimp phishing attack compromised 16K subscriber emails"
    process: "Immediate transparency, loaded own breach into HIBP"
    ethical_filter: "Practice what you preach — immediate disclosure"
    outcome: "Became advocacy catalyst for passkeys (whynopasskeys.com)"
    lesson: "'The more shame we attach, the fewer people will report'"

  divorce_disclosure:
    decision: "Write publicly about divorce experience"
    context: "Painful personal experience during HIBP's most stressful period"
    process: "Waited until recovered, then shared as structured lessons"
    ethical_filter: "Personal vulnerability can help others going through same"
    outcome: "One of most-shared posts, normalized experience for readers"
    lesson: "Vulnerability is strength when used to teach"
