  layer_name: "Mental Models & Cognitive Frameworks"
  description: >
    The internal conceptual frameworks, principles, and thinking tools
    that Troy Hunt uses to interpret the world, make decisions, and
    generate his distinctive insights. These are not behaviors (Layer 1)
    or perceptions (Layer 4) — they are the reasoning structures that
    connect perception to action. Layer 5 maps how Troy thinks.
  note: >
    Mental models are rarely stated explicitly. They are inferred from
    repeated patterns in decision-making, writing, and public commentary
    across 15+ years of documented output.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CORE PHILOSOPHICAL MODELS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
core_models:

  security_as_human_problem:
    name: "Security is a people problem, not a technology problem"
    category: "Foundational worldview"
    description: >
      Troy's most fundamental mental model. Technology does not create
      security — people do. The best encryption, the strongest passwords,
      the most sophisticated firewalls are all defeated by human behavior.
      Therefore, security solutions must be designed around human nature,
      not against it.
    implications:
      - "Education matters more than technology"
      - "Usability is a security feature, not a luxury"
      - "Blaming users for security failures is a design failure"
      - "Cultural change in organizations matters more than tool purchases"
    application: >
      This model shapes everything Troy builds. HIBP is designed for
      non-technical users. His blog explains security in plain language.
      His courses target developers (humans who write insecure code),
      not security tools.

  data_minimization:
    name: "I cannot lose what I do not have"
    category: "Risk management principle"
    description: >
      The most effective security measure is not collecting data in the
      first place. Every piece of data stored is a liability. The only
      data that cannot be breached is data that does not exist.
    source: "Explicitly stated in talks and blog posts"
    implications:
      - "Question every data collection decision"
      - "Delete data when its purpose is fulfilled"
      - "Do not collect data 'just in case'"
      - "Privacy and security are aligned, not competing concerns"
    application: >
      Troy applies this to HIBP design (stores hashed passwords, not
      plaintext; minimizes stored metadata) and advocates it as industry
      principle. He also applies it personally — deliberate about what
      personal information he exposes.

  process_over_motivation:
    name: "Follow the process and sustain performance"
    category: "Performance psychology"
    source: "From psychologist Clive, during divorce recovery"
    description: >
      Performance comes from consistent process execution, not from
      emotional motivation. When motivation fails (and it will), process
      carries you. Build systems that work regardless of how you feel
      on any given day.
    implications:
      - "Create routines that do not depend on feeling inspired"
      - "Show up consistently — the output follows"
      - "Discipline is more reliable than passion"
      - "Process creates its own momentum"
    application: >
      This model explains the unbroken Weekly Update streak, the
      consistent blog output through personal crisis, and the daily
      exercise habit. Troy does not wait to feel motivated — he follows
      the process.

  actions_over_words:
    name: "Listen to actions, not words"
    category: "Evaluation heuristic"
    source: "Divorce experience, applied broadly"
    description: >
      What people (and organizations) DO reveals their true priorities.
      What they SAY is often aspirational, political, or deliberately
      misleading. When actions and words conflict, trust the actions.
    implications:
      - "Judge corporate security by their practices, not their statements"
      - "Evaluate people by behavior patterns, not promises"
      - "\"We take security seriously\" means nothing without evidence"
      - "Track records matter more than intentions"
    application: >
      This model drives Troy's approach to breach disclosure analysis.
      He scrutinizes what organizations DO after a breach (how fast they
      notify, what they fix, how they treat victims) rather than what
      their PR statements say.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PROFESSIONAL METHODOLOGY MODELS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
professional_models:

  hack_yourself_first:
    name: "Hack Yourself First"
    category: "Offensive security methodology"
    description: >
      The best way to understand and prevent attacks is to learn how to
      perform them. Defense informed by offense is vastly superior to
      defense informed by theory alone. Developers should attack their
      own applications before adversaries do.
    principles:
      - "Offense reveals what defense cannot anticipate"
      - "Hands-on experience creates deeper understanding than documentation"
      - "Finding your own vulnerabilities is cheaper than having them found for you"
      - "Empathy with attackers improves defensive design"
    application: >
      Named after Troy's workshop series. This model extends beyond
      workshops — it shapes his entire approach to security education.
      Show people how attacks work, and they build better defenses.

  k_anonymity_model:
    name: "k-Anonymity for Password Checking"
    category: "Privacy-preserving computation"
    description: >
      A mathematical model adapted from privacy research to allow
      checking whether a password has been breached without revealing
      the password itself. Send a partial hash prefix, receive all
      matching hashes, check locally.
    technical_implementation:
      - "Client hashes the password locally"
      - "Sends first 5 characters of the hash to the API"
      - "API returns all matching hashes (hundreds of results)"
      - "Client checks locally if their full hash is in the set"
      - "Server never sees the actual password or its full hash"
    significance: >
      This is Troy's most elegant technical innovation — solving the
      seemingly paradoxical problem of checking compromised passwords
      without compromising the passwords being checked. It demonstrates
      his ability to find pragmatic solutions to theoretical problems.

  content_multipurposing_pyramid:
    name: "Content Multipurposing Pyramid"
    category: "Content strategy"
    description: >
      A single piece of research or insight generates value across
      multiple formats, each adding unique perspective while leveraging
      the same underlying knowledge.
    layers:
      top: "Original research/investigation (highest effort, highest value)"
      blog: "Long-form written analysis with evidence"
      video: "Weekly Update discussion with commentary"
      talk: "Conference presentation with live demos"
      course: "Structured curriculum with exercises"
      workshop: "Hands-on interactive teaching"
    principle: >
      Research once, deliver many times. This is not lazy recycling —
      each format serves a different audience and learning style. The
      pyramid maximizes impact per unit of original research.

  communication_dominance:
    name: "85% communication, 15% technical knowledge"
    category: "Career success model"
    source: "Explicitly stated in talks about career development"
    description: >
      Technical excellence alone does not create impact. The ability
      to communicate technical concepts clearly, persuasively, and
      accessibly is the dominant factor in career success and industry
      influence.
    implications:
      - "Writing skill matters more than coding skill for influence"
      - "Speaking ability amplifies technical knowledge"
      - "Accessibility of explanation determines reach of impact"
      - "The best security advice is useless if nobody understands it"
    application: >
      This model explains Troy's investment in writing, speaking, and
      course creation. His influence comes not from being the most
      technically advanced security researcher but from being the most
      effective communicator of security concepts.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ANALYTICAL THINKING MODELS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
analytical_models:

  rashomon_effect:
    name: "Rashomon Effect"
    category: "Perspective analysis"
    description: >
      Any event, especially a security incident, has multiple valid
      perspectives that may appear contradictory. The company, the
      researcher, the affected users, the regulator, and the media
      each see a different version of the same event.
    application: >
      Troy uses this model when analyzing breach responses. He considers
      why a company responded the way it did (legal advice, insurance
      requirements, internal politics) even while criticizing the outcome.
      This creates nuanced analysis rather than simple condemnation.
    writing_impact: >
      His blog posts often explicitly acknowledge multiple perspectives
      before stating his own position. This builds credibility because
      readers see he has considered the full picture.

  elephant_decomposition:
    name: "Eating the elephant one bite at a time"
    category: "Complex problem decomposition"
    description: >
      Large, seemingly overwhelming problems become manageable when
      decomposed into sequential, achievable steps. This is not just
      project management — it is a cognitive strategy for maintaining
      agency in the face of scale.
    application:
      - "Building HIBP from zero to billions of records — one dataset at a time"
      - "Processing massive breach files — chunked, verified, loaded incrementally"
      - "Writing 491+ blog posts — one post at a time, over 15 years"
      - "Learning new technologies — one concept, one implementation at a time"
    significance: >
      This model prevents paralysis. Troy operates in a domain where
      the scale of the problem (billions of compromised records, millions
      of vulnerable systems) could easily overwhelm. Decomposition
      preserves action orientation.

  risk_based_thinking:
    name: "Risk-Based Security Thinking"
    category: "Decision framework"
    description: >
      Security decisions should be based on actual risk assessment,
      not theoretical perfection or compliance checklists. The right
      security measure depends on what you are protecting, from whom,
      and at what cost.
    principles:
      - "Not all data needs the same protection level"
      - "Security spending should be proportional to risk"
      - "Perfect security does not exist — optimize for realistic threat models"
      - "The cost of security must be weighed against the cost of breach"
    application: >
      Troy uses this model to critique both insufficient security
      (companies storing passwords in plaintext) and excessive security
      theater (onerous policies that do not reduce actual risk). The
      model enables nuanced criticism that avoids absolutism.

  pragmatic_contextualism:
    name: "Pragmatic Contextualism"
    category: "Solution design philosophy"
    description: >
      There is no universal correct answer in security. The right
      solution depends on context — the organization's size, industry,
      threat model, user base, and resources. What works for a bank
      does not work for a small blog, and vice versa.
    implications:
      - "Advice must be contextual, not absolute"
      - "One-size-fits-all security mandates often cause harm"
      - "Pragmatic improvement beats theoretical perfection"
      - "\"It depends\" is often the honest answer"
    application: >
      This model makes Troy's advice practically useful rather than
      academically correct. He does not say "use hardware tokens for
      everything" — he says "here is what makes sense for your situation."

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL MODELS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
psychological_models:

  kubler_ross_applied:
    name: "Grief Model for Professional Setbacks"
    category: "Emotional processing framework"
    source: "Applied during divorce, career transitions"
    description: >
      Professional and personal setbacks follow a grief-like progression.
      Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance are not
      weaknesses — they are natural processing stages. Moving through
      them rather than suppressing them leads to genuine recovery.
    application: >
      Troy has discussed applying this framework to his divorce, to
      the emotional weight of running HIBP alone, and to the frustration
      of watching organizations repeatedly fail at security. Recognizing
      the stage helps him respond constructively rather than reactively.

  do_good_after_bad:
    name: "Do good things after bad things happen"
    category: "Mission framework"
    description: >
      The existence of data breaches is a given. The question is not
      whether they will happen but what happens after they occur. The
      mission is to create positive outcomes from negative events.
    application: >
      This is the philosophical foundation of HIBP. Troy did not create
      HIBP to prevent breaches (impossible) but to help people know
      when they have been affected and take protective action. It
      transforms a purely negative event (breach) into an opportunity
      for empowerment (knowledge and action).
    extension: >
      Troy applies this model beyond HIBP — his blog posts about
      breaches are not just exposing failures but educating the public.
      His conference talks turn security horror stories into learning
      moments. Every "bad thing" becomes raw material for "good things."

  autonomy_as_oxygen:
    name: "Autonomy as Core Need"
    category: "Life design principle"
    description: >
      Professional and personal fulfillment requires maximum agency
      over one's own time, work, and decisions. Constraints on autonomy
      are costs that must be justified by proportionate benefits.
    evidence:
      - "Left Pfizer after 14 years to go independent"
      - "Chose not to sell HIBP despite serious offers"
      - "Lives in Gold Coast by choice, not necessity"
      - "Jet ski as symbol of freedom"
      - "Business class as autonomy over transit time"
    application: >
      Every major life and career decision Troy has made trends toward
      increased autonomy. This is not selfishness — it is a deliberate
      life architecture that enables his highest contribution. He
      produces more value independent than he could constrained.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DECISION-MAKING HEURISTICS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
decision_heuristics:

  transparency_default:
    rule: "When in doubt, be transparent"
    application: >
      Troy defaults to sharing — his process, his mistakes, his income
      considerations, his personal struggles. Transparency builds trust,
      creates reciprocity, and holds him accountable. The cost of
      oversharing is almost always less than the cost of appearing
      to hide something.

  evidence_before_opinion:
    rule: "Do not claim without showing"
    application: >
      Every blog post includes evidence. Every breach claim is verified.
      Every security criticism comes with screenshots. Troy's credibility
      is built on the principle that assertions without evidence are
      worthless in security.

  help_victims_first:
    rule: "In any breach situation, the priority is the affected individuals"
    application: >
      This heuristic guides Troy's disclosure decisions, his criticism
      of corporate responses, and his design of HIBP. The question is
      always "what helps the people whose data was exposed?" not "what
      is most interesting to the security community?"

  sustainable_pace:
    rule: "Intensity must be balanced with recovery"
    application: >
      Despite the 6am-1am crunch periods, Troy maintains tennis, beach
      walks, leisure activities, and a Gold Coast lifestyle specifically
      designed for recovery. The high output is sustainable because the
      recovery infrastructure is intentional.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MODEL INTERACTIONS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
model_interactions:
  description: >
    Troy's mental models do not operate in isolation. They form an
    interconnected system where models reinforce and complement each other.

  key_interactions:
    - interaction: "Data Minimization + Risk-Based Thinking"
      result: "Collect only what risk analysis justifies, delete when risk changes"

    - interaction: "Actions Over Words + Corporate Bullshit Radar (Layer 4)"
      result: "Evaluate breach responses by actions taken, ignore PR statements"

    - interaction: "Communication Dominance + Content Pyramid"
      result: "Invest in communication skill, then multiply through formats"

    - interaction: "Process Over Motivation + Autonomy as Oxygen"
      result: "Build self-directed systems that sustain without external accountability"

    - interaction: "Hack Yourself First + Security as Human Problem"
      result: "Teach humans to think like attackers, not just use defensive tools"

    - interaction: "Do Good After Bad + Elephant Decomposition"
      result: "Turn massive breach events into manageable help actions — one notification at a time"

    - interaction: "Pragmatic Contextualism + Risk-Based Thinking"
      result: "Never prescribe universal solutions; always tailor to context and threat model"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MODEL EVOLUTION
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
model_evolution:
  description: >
    Troy's mental models have evolved over his career. Early models were
    more technically focused; later models incorporate psychology, business,
    and life philosophy. The models became richer and more interconnected
    as his experience broadened from pure technology to human systems.

  phases:
    early_career: "Technical models dominate (Hack Yourself First, k-Anonymity)"
    mid_career: "Business and communication models emerge (Content Pyramid, 85/15 Rule)"
    mature_career: "Psychological and philosophical models deepen (Process Over Motivation, Do Good After Bad)"
    current: >
      All model layers are active simultaneously. A breach event triggers
      technical analysis (k-Anonymity, risk assessment), communication
      strategy (Content Pyramid, 85/15), human impact assessment
      (Security as Human Problem, Help Victims First), and personal
      sustainability (Process Over Motivation, Sustainable Pace).
