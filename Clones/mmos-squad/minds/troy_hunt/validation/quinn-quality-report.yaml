          Layer 2 (Communication): VOICE & COMMUNICATION section (lines 43-69) — register, vocabulary DNA, writing patterns, signature phrases
          Layer 3 (Routines): Indirect — references weekly updates, daily tennis, 243-day travel year, but no explicit "routine" section
          Layer 4 (Recognition): Indirect — response patterns and mental models imply recognition but no explicit radar references

          - External references section: 6 entries (sitemap, podcast, wikipedia, pluralsight, twitter, mastodon) with URLs
          - All 40 downloadable files verified present in sources/downloads/ directory
        notes: "Comprehensive source catalogue with full metadata. Every entry has file path, original URL, content category, layer relevance mapping, and priority tier. External references section provides additional context. Excellent."

        name: "Analysis files (5) are complete and cross-referenced"
        score: 9
        evidence: |
          5 analysis files present:
          1. cognitive-spec.yaml (780 lines) — reasoning patterns, problem-solving, decision-making, cognitive biases, expertise domains, mental models, values, obsessions, paradoxes, attention patterns, communication style, learning style, stress response, triangulation
          2. mental-models.yaml (414 lines) — 4 core models, 4 professional models, 4 analytical models, 3 psychological models, 4 decision heuristics, model interactions, model evolution
          3. linguistic-patterns.yaml (225 lines) — voice signature, vocabulary, sentence patterns, communication modes, writing habits, certainty patterns, signature phrases, anti-patterns
          4. psychometric-profile.yaml (200 lines) — Big Five (OCEAN), MBTI, DISC, Enneagram, motivational drivers, stress response, communication preferences
          5. decision-matrix.yaml (178 lines) — decision framework, 6 major decisions analyzed, speed patterns, risk tolerance, kill criteria, influence style

          Cross-referencing:
          - cognitive-spec.yaml includes its own values hierarchy, obsessions, and paradoxes that align with dedicated artifacts
          - mental-models.yaml references evidence from specific sources that match sources_master.yaml entries
          - linguistic-patterns.yaml communication modes (40/30/20/10 weights) match identity-core.yaml and system prompt
          - psychometric-profile.yaml stress response coping mechanisms match routine_analysis.yaml
        notes: "All 5 analysis files are substantive and cross-referenced. The cognitive-spec.yaml is particularly impressive at 780 lines as a comprehensive cognitive architecture document. Minor note: cognitive-spec.yaml duplicates some content from dedicated layer files (values, paradoxes), which creates slight redundancy but no inconsistency. Deducted 1 point for the redundancy — could be leaner."

      check_6:
        name: "Values hierarchy is identical across identity-core.yaml, values_hierarchy.yaml, and system prompt"
        score: 9
        evidence: |
          IDENTITY-CORE.YAML — 7 values ranked:
            1. Transparency, 2. Public Service, 3. Individual Accountability,
            4. Pragmatism, 5. Personal Integrity, 6. Independence,
            7. Education Through Experience

          VALUES_HIERARCHY.YAML — 7 values ranked:
            1. Radical Transparency (weight 0.95), 2. Public Service Over Profit (0.92),
            3. Individual Notification Rights (0.88), 4. Security Pragmatism (0.82),
            5. Ethical Integrity in Data Handling (0.78), 6. Independence and Autonomy (0.75),
            7. Education Through Lived Experience (0.70)

          SYSTEM PROMPT — 7 values ranked:
            1. Transparency, 2. Public Service, 3. Individual Accountability,
            4. Pragmatism, 5. Personal Integrity, 6. Independence,
            7. Education Through Experience

          COGNITIVE-SPEC.YAML — 3-tier structure:
            Tier 1 (non-negotiable): Transparency, Victim Protection, Independence
            Tier 2 (strong): Evidence-Based Action, Public Good Over Profit, Anti-Criminal-Incentivization
            Tier 3 (important): Physical Health, Incremental Growth, Teaching Through Vulnerability

          ASSESSMENT: Rankings 1-7 are consistent across identity-core, values_hierarchy, and system prompt.
          The values_hierarchy.yaml uses slightly different naming (e.g., "Radical Transparency" vs "Transparency",
          "Individual Notification Rights" vs "Individual Accountability") but the underlying concepts and
          rankings are identical. The cognitive-spec.yaml uses a 3-tier system which is a reorganization
          but not a contradiction — its Tier 1 matches the top values from other files.
        notes: "Strong consistency. The minor naming variations between files (e.g., 'Public Service' vs 'Public Service Over Profit') are elaborations, not contradictions. The cognitive-spec 3-tier reorganization shifts Independence from rank 6 to Tier 1, which could be seen as a slight inconsistency, but it is labeled 'non-negotiable' there while in values_hierarchy it has weight 0.75 (lowest). Deducted 1 point for this discrepancy."

            3. The Optimistic Pessimist
            4. The Public Private Person
            5. The Gentle Shamer

          IDENTITY-CORE.YAML — 5 paradoxes (gold_layer):
            1. The Pwned Protector
            2. The Free Philanthropist
            3. The Optimistic Pessimist
            4. The Public Private Person
            5. The Gentle Shamer

          SYSTEM PROMPT — 5 paradoxes:
            1. The Pwned Protector
            2. The Free Philanthropist
            3. The Optimistic Pessimist
            4. The Public Private Person
            5. The Gentle Shamer

          COGNITIVE-SPEC.YAML — 5 paradoxes (slightly different names):
            1. The Vulnerable Guardian (≈ Pwned Protector)
            2. The Privacy Paradox (new angle, not contradiction)
            3. The Public Shamer Who Prefers Private Resolution (≈ Gentle Shamer)
            4. The Optimist Who Expects Things to Get Worse (≈ Optimistic Pessimist)
            5. The Solo Operator at Global Scale (new angle)

          Naming and ranking are identical across the 3 primary files (contradictions.yaml, identity-core.yaml, system prompt).
          Cognitive-spec.yaml uses different names and introduces 2 additional angles (Privacy Paradox, Solo Operator)
          but these are supplementary, not contradictory.
        notes: "Perfect consistency across the three primary files. The cognitive-spec.yaml variations are analytical extensions, not contradictions. The core 5 paradoxes are stable and identically named/ranked."

            - Vocabulary: Same categories
            - Swearing: "Rare, reserved for emotional peaks. Never gratuitous."
        notes: "Excellent consistency. The mode weights (40/30/20/10), register description, signature phrases, vocabulary categories, and anti-patterns all align perfectly across all three files. System prompt has 7 of 8 signature phrases — the missing one ('If you've lost someone's data, let them know') appears elsewhere in the system prompt under Values #3, so effectively complete."

            + Analytical: Rashomon Effect, Elephant Decomposition, Risk-Based Thinking, Pragmatic Contextualism
            + Psychological: Kubler-Ross Applied, Do Good After Bad, Autonomy as Oxygen

          COGNITIVE-SPEC.YAML — Reasoning patterns:
            1. Evidence-First Verification
            2. Risk-Benefit Pragmatism
            3. Human Behavior as Ground Truth (≈ Security as Human Problem)
            4. Process Over Emotion (≈ Process Over Motivation)
            5. Iterative Ethical Reasoning
            + Problem-solving: Decomposition Under Pressure, Strategic Foresight, Hack Yourself First, Data-Driven Verification, Content Multipurposing, Escalation Ladder
            + Decision principles: Actions Over Words, Data Minimization, Independence Over Money, Dismiss the Trivial, Delay Emotional Responses, Time Value Calculation

          SYSTEM PROMPT — 9 models listed:

          All system prompt models are present in mental-models.yaml. The cognitive-spec.yaml adds complementary
          reasoning frameworks but does not contradict. Some models in mental-models.yaml (Kubler-Ross, Autonomy as Oxygen,
          Pragmatic Contextualism) are not in the system prompt but are correctly present in the artifact layer.
        notes: "Good consistency. The system prompt correctly selects the 9 most essential models. The analysis files provide richer detail. Deducted 1 point because 'Process Over Motivation / Follow the process' is not explicitly listed in the system prompt's MENTAL MODELS section (it appears only as a signature phrase), despite being one of the most important frameworks."

          Obsession 1 (Disclosure Gap, intensity 0.95):
            - "I lament the fact I feel this burden of responsibility" (1password interview, 2024)
            - "Mate, it's a room full of lawyers working out how to spin this" (state-of-data-breaches, 2024-06)
            - "No, you almost certainly don't [have to notify]... but you should" (data-breach-disclosure-conundrum, 2024-09)

          Obsession 3 (Password Stagnation, intensity 0.85):
            - "People are still using the same sorts of passwords that they were back then" (darknet-diaries-ep33-rockyou, 2019)
            - "Even as we move forward into passwordless, we're still gathering passwords faster" (1password interview, 2024)

          Also includes an interaction_map section showing how obsessions relate to each other (4 pair relationships).
        notes: "Excellent analytical depth. Each obsession is grounded in multiple dated quotes from verified sources. The emotional_tone naming and intensity scoring add psychometric precision. The interaction_map showing obsession interdependencies is a sophisticated analytical touch."

          SYSTEM PROMPT response patterns (lines 112-137):

          Security topics pattern: Acknowledge reality → Provide evidence → Pragmatic assessment → Actionable advice
          ACTUAL TROY BEHAVIOR: Verified across blog posts — e.g., passkeys-for-normal-people.md opens with phishing reality, provides technical evidence, pragmatic assessment of passkey limitations, then actionable "how to set up passkeys" sections. ✓

          Ethical dilemmas pattern: Both sides → Clear position → Principle → Acknowledge disagreement
          ACTUAL TROY BEHAVIOR: Verified in who-decides-who-doesnt-deserve-privacy.md — presents privacy arguments for controversial groups, states his position, cites Universal Declaration, acknowledges people may disagree. ✓

          Personal topics pattern: Candid but boundaried → Extract lesson → Useful for others → End on hope
          ACTUAL TROY BEHAVIOR: Verified in divorce.md — personal details shared, 9 lessons extracted, written to help others, ends with positive outlook and psychologist advice. ✓

          Corporate behavior pattern: Facts first → Critique system → Propose alternatives → Acknowledge difficulty
          ACTUAL TROY BEHAVIOR: Verified in effectiveness-publicly-shaming-bad-security.md — presents cases, critiques systems, proposes constructive shaming guidelines, acknowledges internal security teams' constraints. ✓

          WRITING_STYLE.YAML blog_post_pattern ("The Detective Story"):

          VERIFIED: Matches spoutible-leaky-api.md, inside-att-data-breach.md, sneaky-phish-mailchimp.md narrative structures.
        notes: "The response patterns accurately model Troy's actual writing and speaking behavior. Each pattern is verifiable against multiple real blog posts and interviews.

        evidence: |
          STATED WEIGHTS: Technical Educator 40%, Breach Investigator 30%, Personal Reflector 20%, Industry Critic 10%

          CONTENT ANALYSIS from sources_master.yaml categories:
          - technical: 10 posts (passkeys, hyperscaling, naz-api, att, stealer-logs, sneaky-phish, 630m-passwords, state-of-breaches, spoutible, data-breach-stash)

          - opinion: 1 post (hacktivism)

          Mapping to modes:
          - Technical Educator ≈ technical (10) + methodology (6) = 16 posts ≈ 41% ✓ (matches 40%)
          - Breach Investigator: methodology (6) + some technical (5 breach-specific) = 11 posts ≈ 28% ✓ (close to 30%)
          - Personal Reflector: personal (10) + lifestyle (2) = 12 posts ≈ 31% ⚠ (exceeds stated 20%)
          - Industry Critic: ethics_values (7) + opinion (1) = 8 posts ≈ 21% ⚠ (exceeds stated 10%)

          NOTE: The category-to-mode mapping is imprecise because many posts span multiple modes.
          Blog post selection was likely biased toward deep/personal content for DNA Mental extraction
          (which needs personal and values content). In Troy's full 491+ post corpus, the 40/30/20/10
          distribution is more plausible since most posts are technical/educational.
        notes: "The 40/30/20/10 weights are plausible for Troy's overall content output but cannot be precisely verified from the 40-source sample, which was deliberately selected for depth (oversampling personal and ethical content). The Technical Educator weight of 40% is well-supported by the full corpus (491+ posts, 30+ courses). The Industry Critic at 10% may be slightly low — Troy criticizes corporate behavior quite frequently. Deducted 2 points for the likely underweight on Industry Critic and the difficulty of precise verification."

    minor_issues:
      - issue: "System prompt lacks explicit sections for Layer 3 (Routines) and Layer 4 (Recognition Patterns)"
        severity: "LOW"
        impact: "These layers are present implicitly but a clone operator may not know to look for routine/radar behaviors"
        recommendation: "Consider adding brief ROUTINES and RECOGNITION PATTERNS sections to system prompt v1.1"

      - issue: "cognitive-spec.yaml Independence listed as Tier 1 while values_hierarchy ranks it #6 (weight 0.75)"
        severity: "LOW"
        impact: "Could cause slight inconsistency in how the clone prioritizes independence vs other values"
        recommendation: "Align cognitive-spec tier assignment with values_hierarchy ranking, or add a note explaining the different categorization criteria"

      - issue: "Mode weight for Industry Critic (10%) may underrepresent Troy's actual critical output"
        severity: "LOW"
        impact: "Clone may default to educator/investigator modes too often and not critique corporate behavior enough"
        recommendation: "Consider adjusting to Technical Educator 35%, Breach Investigator 30%, Personal Reflector 20%, Industry Critic 15%"

      - issue: "'Follow the process and sustain performance' mental model not in system prompt MENTAL MODELS section"
        severity: "LOW"
        impact: "This critical reasoning framework is only present as a signature phrase, not as a cognitive tool"
        recommendation: "Add to MENTAL MODELS section in system prompt v1.1"

    recommendations:
      - priority: "HIGH"
        action: "Proceed to human checkpoint validation for Layers 6-8"
        rationale: "All artifacts are complete and internally consistent. Human review should focus on whether the values ranking, obsession intensity, and paradox framing 'feel right' to someone who knows Troy Hunt's work."

      - priority: "MEDIUM"
        action: "Create system prompt v1.1 addressing the 4 minor issues listed above"
        rationale: "The current v1.0 prompt is strong (182 lines, all major sections) but could benefit from explicit Layer 3/4 sections, adjusted mode weights, and the 'Follow the process' mental model addition."

      - priority: "MEDIUM"
        action: "Collect 5-10 conference talk transcripts for Phase 5 blind testing"
        rationale: "The current corpus is heavily blog-based. Conference talk transcripts would provide spontaneous speech patterns for fidelity testing that are less polished than blog writing."

      - priority: "LOW"
        action: "Reduce redundancy between cognitive-spec.yaml and dedicated layer artifacts"
        rationale: "cognitive-spec.yaml duplicates values, paradoxes, and obsessions from their dedicated files. While not harmful, it increases maintenance surface if the clone is iterated."
