  layer: 4
  layer_name: "Recognition Patterns — Mental Radars"
  description: >
    The perceptual filters and pattern-recognition systems that Troy Hunt
    has developed over 25+ years in technology and security. These are the
    things he notices that others miss — the signals his brain automatically
    flags as significant. Layer 4 maps what his attention is tuned to detect.
  development_context: >
    These radars are not innate. They are calibrated through processing
    thousands of breach datasets, reading thousands of corporate responses,
    analyzing hundreds of security configurations, and engaging with millions
    of users through HIBP. Each radar represents accumulated pattern
    recognition from high-volume, high-stakes experience.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BREACH DATA RADARS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
breach_data_radars:

  fabrication_detection:
    name: "Fake Breach Radar"
    description: >
      Troy can identify fabricated or recycled breach data rapidly. After
      processing thousands of datasets, he has developed an intuitive sense
      for what real breach data looks like versus compiled, scraped, or
      invented datasets.
    signals_detected:
      - "Data structure inconsistencies (real breaches have messy, organic data)"
      - "Email domain distribution anomalies (fake data has suspicious patterns)"
      - "Password patterns that indicate generation rather than human creation"
      - "Recycled data from known previous breaches repackaged as new"
      - "Implausible record counts relative to the claimed source"
      - "Missing fields that a real database would contain"
    verification_methodology:
      - "Cross-reference sample emails against known breach databases"
      - "Check if affected users confirm receiving legitimate communications from the org"
      - "Analyze password distribution for signs of authenticity"
      - "Verify data structure matches the claimed source's technology stack"
    confidence: "Very high — years of calibration against confirmed breaches"

  breach_severity_assessment:
    name: "Impact Radar"
    description: >
      Instantly gauges the severity and implications of a breach based on
      data types exposed, volume, and the nature of the affected organization.
    signals_detected:
      - "Plaintext passwords (immediate red flag for organizational competence)"
      - "Government IDs, SSNs, or financial data (escalates severity)"
      - "Healthcare or children's data (triggers special handling)"
      - "Authentication tokens or API keys (ongoing active risk)"
      - "Data that enables identity theft versus mere embarrassment"
    response_calibration: >
      Troy adjusts his urgency, disclosure approach, and communication
      tone based on severity assessment. A breach of email addresses gets
      different treatment than a breach of medical records.

  data_enrichment_detection:
    name: "Aggregation Radar"
    description: >
      Recognizes when a dataset is not from a single breach but aggregated
      from multiple sources, scraped from public profiles, or enriched with
      data purchased from brokers.
    signals_detected:
      - "Multiple data schemas merged into one file"
      - "Timestamps spanning impossible ranges for a single event"
      - "Mix of data freshness levels within the same dataset"
      - "Fields that the claimed source would not logically possess"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CORPORATE BEHAVIOR RADARS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
corporate_behavior_radars:

  spin_detection:
    name: "Corporate Bullshit Radar"
    description: >
      Troy has a finely tuned detector for corporate communications that
      prioritize reputation management over user protection. After years
      of contacting organizations about breaches and reading their public
      responses, he recognizes the playbook instantly.
    signals_detected:
      - "\"We take security seriously\" — the universal hollow assurance"
      - "Passive voice to avoid accountability (\"data was accessed\" vs \"we were hacked\")"
      - "Minimizing language (\"a small number of users\" when millions are affected)"
      - "Burying the breach in a longer announcement about \"security improvements\""
      - "Delayed disclosure timed for Friday afternoons or holiday weekends"
      - "Lawyer-reviewed language that is technically true but functionally deceptive"
      - "Blaming users (\"we recommend customers use strong passwords\")"
    emotional_response: >
      This radar triggers Troy's most visible frustration. His blog posts
      about corporate spin are his sharpest and most sarcastic writing.
      He sees spin as a betrayal of the affected users who deserve honesty.

  stonewalling_pattern:
    name: "Silence Radar"
    description: >
      Detects when organizations are deliberately ignoring breach
      notifications, hoping the problem will go away.
    signals_detected:
      - "No response to multiple contact attempts via different channels"
      - "Acknowledgment without follow-up or action"
      - "Redirecting to legal department as a delay tactic"
      - "Claiming to investigate indefinitely without resolution"
    troy_response: >
      Persistence. Troy documents every contact attempt and uses the
      documented silence as evidence in his eventual public disclosure.
      The silence becomes part of the story.

  ambulance_chasing:
    name: "Opportunism Radar"
    description: >
      Identifies companies and individuals who exploit breach events for
      their own commercial benefit rather than genuinely helping victims.
    signals_detected:
      - "Credit monitoring companies amplifying fear to sell services"
      - "Security vendors using breaches as marketing opportunities"
      - "Consultants offering \"breach response\" services at inflated prices"
      - "Media outlets sensationalizing breaches for clicks"
    distinction: >
      Troy differentiates between legitimate breach response services and
      opportunistic exploitation. The line is whether the primary motivation
      is helping victims or profiting from their misfortune.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SECURITY TECHNICAL RADARS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
technical_security_radars:

  misconfiguration_detection:
    name: "Broken Security Radar"
    description: >
      Troy's technical background means he automatically evaluates the
      security posture of websites and services he encounters, even
      casually.
    signals_detected:
      - "Missing HTTPS or improperly configured TLS certificates"
      - "Lack of HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)"
      - "Mixed content warnings"
      - "Verbose error messages exposing internal system details"
      - "Default credentials or admin panels exposed to the internet"
      - "API endpoints returning excessive data"
      - "Security headers missing from HTTP responses"
      - "Outdated software versions visible in headers or page source"
    context: >
      This radar is always on. Troy has written blog posts about security
      issues he discovered while booking flights, ordering food, or doing
      routine personal tasks. Every website is evaluated.

  password_antipattern_detection:
    name: "Password Stupidity Radar"
    description: >
      Identifies password policies and implementations that actively
      harm security while appearing to improve it.
    signals_detected:
      - "Maximum password length limits (indicates plaintext or weak hashing)"
      - "Character restrictions (no special characters allowed)"
      - "Mandatory rotation policies without breach triggers"
      - "Password composition rules that reduce entropy"
      - "Password fields that block paste (prevents password manager use)"
      - "Security questions as password recovery (knowledge-based auth weakness)"
      - "SMS-only 2FA with no TOTP or hardware key option"
    emotional_response: >
      Password stupidity triggers a combination of frustration and dark
      humor in Troy's writing. He has been writing about this for over a
      decade and the same mistakes keep recurring.

  usability_security_conflict:
    name: "UX vs Security Radar"
    description: >
      Spots cases where security measures are implemented in ways that
      undermine their own effectiveness by making them too difficult for
      users to actually use.
    signals_detected:
      - "2FA implementations so cumbersome that users disable them"
      - "Password requirements so complex that users write them on sticky notes"
      - "Security warnings so frequent that users develop blindness to them"
      - "Cookie consent dialogs that obscure actual security warnings"
      - "Login flows that prevent password managers from functioning"
    philosophy: >
      Troy believes that security which users cannot or will not use is
      not security at all. His radar flags implementations that are
      technically secure but practically useless.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL RADARS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
social_radars:

  beg_bounty_detection:
    name: "Beg Bounty Radar"
    description: >
      Distinguishes between legitimate security research reports and
      low-effort attempts to extract payment for trivial or nonexistent
      vulnerabilities.
    signals_detected:
      - "Generic vulnerability scanners run against a target with no analysis"
      - "\"Missing security headers\" reports without context of actual risk"
      - "Template-based reports sent en masse to many organizations"
      - "Aggressive follow-ups demanding payment for non-vulnerabilities"
      - "Threats to disclose if payment is not received"
    significance: >
      Troy has written extensively about beg bounties because they
      undermine the legitimate security research community and create
      adversarial relationships between researchers and organizations.

  breach_fatigue_detection:
    name: "Apathy Radar"
    description: >
      Recognizes when the public, media, or organizations have become
      desensitized to breach notifications and security warnings.
    signals_detected:
      - "Declining media coverage of objectively serious breaches"
      - "Users not changing passwords even after confirmed compromise"
      - "\"I don't have anything worth stealing\" responses"
      - "Organizations treating breaches as routine cost of business"
      - "Decreasing engagement with HIBP notification emails"
    concern: >
      Breach fatigue is one of Troy's deepest ongoing concerns. The
      normalization of data breaches means people stop protecting
      themselves precisely when the threat is growing.

  regulation_theater_detection:
    name: "Regulatory Theater Radar"
    description: >
      Identifies when regulations and compliance frameworks protect
      institutions rather than the individuals they claim to serve.
    signals_detected:
      - "Regulations that create paperwork without improving security outcomes"
      - "Cookie consent dialogs that annoy users without protecting privacy"
      - "GDPR enforcement that punishes small operators while big tech gets fines as cost of business"
      - "Compliance checkboxes that create false sense of security"
      - "Regulations written by people who do not understand technology"
    nuance: >
      Troy is not anti-regulation. He supports well-designed regulation
      that creates genuine security improvements. His radar flags
      regulation that is security theater — looks good, does nothing.

  reputation_over_victims:
    name: "Priorities Radar"
    description: >
      Detects when organizations prioritize protecting their brand
      reputation over helping breach victims.
    signals_detected:
      - "Hiring crisis PR firms before notifying affected users"
      - "Threatening legal action against security researchers"
      - "Delaying disclosure to avoid stock price impact"
      - "Framing breach notifications as proactive security measures"
      - "Lobbying to weaken breach notification requirements"
    troy_response: >
      This radar triggers Troy's strongest moral reactions. He views the
      obligation to breach victims as paramount and corporate reputation
      as secondary. His blog posts on this topic are his most passionate.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# META-PATTERN RADAR
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
meta_patterns:

  password_manager_autopilot:
    name: "Automation Failure Radar"
    description: >
      After being personally phished (Mailchimp/Twilio incident), Troy
      developed heightened awareness of when automated security tools
      fail to protect against social engineering.
    key_insight: >
      His password manager would NOT have auto-filled credentials on
      the phishing site because the domain was wrong. But he manually
      entered them. This experience sharpened his radar for the gap
      between having security tools and actually benefiting from them.
    signals_detected:
      - "Password managers that do not auto-fill (domain mismatch = warning)"
      - "2FA codes entered on phishing sites (real-time phishing)"
      - "Security tools that require human override in the critical moment"

  cross_breach_pattern_recognition:
    name: "Systemic Failure Radar"
    description: >
      After processing thousands of breaches, Troy sees patterns that
      span individual incidents and reveal systemic industry failures.
    signals_detected:
      - "Same vulnerability classes appearing across different industries"
      - "Third-party vendors as common breach vectors"
      - "Credential reuse enabling breach chains"
      - "Industry-specific blind spots (healthcare, education, government)"
    value: >
      This radar allows Troy to write about breaches not just as isolated
      events but as symptoms of deeper systemic problems. His most
      impactful writing connects individual breaches to industry-wide
      patterns.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RADAR CALIBRATION
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
calibration_notes:
  continuous_refinement: >
    Troy's radars are not static. Each new breach, each corporate
    interaction, each policy failure adds data that refines detection
    sensitivity. The radars get sharper over time.
  false_positive_management: >
    Troy is careful about verification before public claims. His
    methodology includes multiple confirmation steps before declaring
    a breach genuine. The radars flag signals; investigation confirms.
  personal_experience_as_calibrator: >
    Being phished himself was a powerful calibration event. It shifted
    his radar from purely external observation to include self-awareness
    of his own vulnerability. This made his subsequent writing more
    empathetic and practically useful.
