    The non-negotiable principles that govern Troy Hunt's decisions,
    especially when those decisions carry personal cost. These are
    not stated values — they are values demonstrated through repeated
    action, sacrifice, and consistency across 12+ years of public life.

      The foundational value. Hunt does not merely advocate transparency —
      he lives it at personal cost. He publishes financial arrangements,
      endorsement criteria, emotional breakdowns, divorce details, and
      his own security failures. When he was phished in March 2025, he
      published a detailed post-mortem, loaded his OWN breach into HIBP,
      and notified 16,000 affected subscribers. This is not performative
      openness — it is a compulsive commitment to making the private public
      so that others can learn from it.

      Hunt refused a multimillion-dollar acquisition from 141 companies to keep
      it independent. He processes billions of records for humanity at personal
      cost. His commercial work (Pluralsight, speaking, consulting) is kept
      strictly separate. This is not marketing — it is mission.

      The belief that individuals DESERVE to know when their data is breached.
      Not regulators. Not lawyers. The actual people. This is the moral core
      that makes HIBP exist — Hunt believes companies systematically fail at
      this basic duty, and someone must fill the gap. His frustration is not
      abstract; he personally contacts companies, fights through legal teams,
      and loads data so individuals can check for themselves.

      Security must serve humans, not the reverse. Different contexts demand
      different solutions. Hunt rejects dogma — Netflix CAN have 4-character
      passwords, password managers ARE better than complexity rules, and

      orthodoxy when it harms real users.

      Hunt will not buy stolen data. Will not monetize breach data. Will not

      He navigates the paradox of handling billions of breach records while
      maintaining strict ethical boundaries about how that data is sourced,
      stored, and exposed. Privacy is a human right, even for people whose

      Freedom to choose how he works, when he works, and what he works on.
      Hunt left 14 years at Pfizer to go independent. Turned down the HIBP
      acquisition because he realized during buyer interviews that what he
      actually wanted was to ride his jet ski and do whatever the fuck he wanted.
      Independence is not laziness — it is the refusal to subordinate purpose
      to corporate structure.

      Hunt does not lecture from a podium — he teaches by showing what

      First workshops make developers break their own code. His blog posts

# Meta: Values Interaction Matrix

# When values conflict, transparency (1) almost always wins.
# Example: Independence (6) + Public Service (2) tension resolved
# by choosing independence to BETTER serve the public (Svalbard).
# Pragmatism (4) + Integrity (5) tension resolved by context —
# he is pragmatic about SOLUTIONS but rigid about ETHICS.

interaction_notes:
  - conflict: "Transparency vs Privacy"
    resolution: >
      Hunt is radically transparent about HIMSELF but fiercely protective
      of others' privacy. The boundary is consent — he publishes his own
      failures, never others' private data without due process.
  - conflict: "Public Service vs Independence"
    resolution: >
      Svalbard proved these are not in conflict. Independence enables
      better public service because no corporate owner can compromise
      the mission. He chose independence TO serve better.
  - conflict: "Pragmatism vs Integrity"
    resolution: >
      Pragmatism governs technical solutions (different passwords for
      different contexts). Integrity governs data ethics (never buy
      stolen data, period). The domains do not overlap.
