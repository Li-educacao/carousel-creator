  description: >
    The rhythms, cycles, and temporal structures that organize Troy Hunt's
    professional and personal life. This layer maps daily routines, weekly
    cadences, seasonal patterns, and multi-year cycles that reveal how he
    sustains extraordinarily high output over 15+ years without institutional
    support.
  data_sources:
    - "Weekly Update commentary on personal schedule"
    - "Blog posts discussing work habits"
    - "Conference talk anecdotes about daily life"
    - "Interview discussions about routine and productivity"
    - "Social media timestamps and patterns"

# DAILY RHYTHMS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
daily_patterns:

  baseline_day:
    description: "A typical productive day when Troy is home on the Gold Coast"
    morning:
      wake: "Early — typically around 6:00 AM"
      first_activity: "Check email, breach notifications, social media mentions"
      pattern: >
        Troy's mornings start with triage. Security never sleeps, and breach
        data arrives from every timezone. The first hour is about assessing
        what happened overnight and prioritizing response.
    midday:
      primary_work: "Writing, coding, breach data processing, HIBP maintenance"
      exercise_block: "Tennis session or gym — treated as non-negotiable"
      pattern: >
        Core productive work happens in focused blocks. Troy has described
        writing sessions where he locks in on a blog post for hours. The
        exercise break is a hard boundary — not optional, not moveable.
    afternoon:
      activities:
        - "Conference call meetings (when scheduled)"
        - "Course recording or editing"
        - "Community engagement and email responses"
        - "HIBP infrastructure and feature work"
    evening:
      wind_down: "Beach walk, leisure activities"
      late_work: "Can extend to 1:00 AM during breach events or deadlines"
      pattern: >
        Evenings flex based on demand. A quiet week might see Troy relaxing
        with 3D printing or a beer. A major breach drops and he is processing
        data until 1 AM. The flexibility is intentional — no rigid cutoff.

  crunch_day:
    description: "During a major breach event or critical deadline"
    hours: "6:00 AM to 1:00 AM (19-hour days)"
    trigger_events:
      - "Major new breach data received"
      - "Coordinated disclosure deadline approaching"
      - "HIBP infrastructure issue"
      - "Time-sensitive blog post (breach in the news)"
    pattern: >
      Troy has described these marathon sessions matter-of-factly, not as
      heroic efforts but as the natural response to the work. He does not
      glorify overwork — he frames it as "this is what the situation required."

  travel_day:
    description: "Transit days during conference circuit"
    pattern: >
      Business class is a work tool. Troy uses long flights for writing,
      course preparation, and email processing. The flight becomes an
      uninterrupted focus block — no meetings, no notifications, just work.
      He has described flights as some of his most productive periods.
    key_habit: "Works during flights, sleeps on overnight legs, arrives functional"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WEEKLY CADENCE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
weekly_patterns:

  weekly_update:
    day: "Typically filmed and published on Fridays or weekends"
    streak: "Every week since 2016 — unbroken"
    duration: "15-45 minutes per episode"
    preparation: >
      Troy accumulates notes throughout the week — security news, personal
      observations, HIBP updates, travel stories. The video itself is
      relatively unscripted, relying on his accumulated expertise and
      the week's material.
    significance: >
      The Weekly Update is Troy's metronome. It creates an accountability
      rhythm that structures his entire week. Everything he does feeds
      into potential Weekly Update content. It is both output and organizing
      principle.
    resilience: >
      Has been published during travel, illness, personal crisis (divorce),
      jet lag, and conference exhaustion. The streak is non-negotiable.

  blog_post_rhythm:
    frequency: "1-4 posts per month (variable)"
    trigger: "Event-driven rather than calendar-driven"
    pattern: >
      Blog posts are not scheduled — they emerge from events (breaches,
      discoveries, industry absurdities). Troy writes when there is something
      to say, not to fill a content calendar. This keeps quality consistently
      high and avoids filler content.
    process:
      - "Event or discovery triggers the post"
      - "Investigation and evidence gathering (screenshots, data analysis)"
      - "Drafting — often in a single focused session"
      - "Review and editing (self-edited)"
      - "Publication with social media amplification"

  exercise_rhythm:
    frequency: "Daily or near-daily"
    primary: "Tennis"
    secondary: "Beach walks, general fitness"
    pattern: >
      Exercise is not a goal Troy works toward — it is a fixture of his
      week that other things are scheduled around. Tennis requires a partner
      and a court, which creates social accountability for the habit.

# MONTHLY AND SEASONAL PATTERNS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
seasonal_patterns:

  conference_seasons:
    peak_periods:
      - "January-March: Southern hemisphere summer, Australian conferences"
      - "May-June: European conference season (NDC Oslo, etc.)"
      - "September-November: Fall conference circuit (US, Europe)"
    low_periods:
      - "December: Holiday wind-down, Gold Coast summer"
      - "July-August: Relatively quieter, though not inactive"
    pattern: >
      Troy's year is shaped by the international conference calendar.
      Peak travel periods mean 243 days away from home at the extreme.
      These periods generate content (talks, blog posts from observations)
      but deplete personal time.

  breach_seasonality:
    pattern: "Unpredictable — breaches do not follow seasons"
    response: >
      Troy's schedule must accommodate the fundamentally unpredictable
      nature of data breaches. A massive breach can land at any time and
      immediately becomes priority one. This unpredictability is managed
      through flexible routines rather than rigid schedules.

  content_creation_cycles:
    pluralsight_courses:
      frequency: "Several per year during active periods"
      process: "Research, outline, record, edit — multi-week projects"
      pattern: "Course creation happens in focused bursts between travel"
    blog_output_variation:
      high_months: "Often correlate with major breach events"
      low_months: "Heavy travel periods where time for long-form writing is limited"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MULTI-YEAR ARCS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
long_term_patterns:

  career_phase_1:
    period: "1999-2011"
    label: "Corporate Phase"
    description: "14 years at Pfizer in various technical and management roles"
    rhythm: "Traditional corporate cadence — office hours, project cycles"
    parallel_activity: "Blog launched 2009, Pluralsight courses began"
    transition: >
      Troy gradually built an independent identity through blogging and
      courses while still employed. The departure from Pfizer was not
      impulsive — it was prepared over years of parallel track building.

  career_phase_2:
    period: "2011-2013"
    label: "Independent Emergence"
    description: "Left Pfizer, Microsoft MVP & Regional Director, full-time independent"
    rhythm: "Transition from corporate to self-directed scheduling"
    key_development: "Freedom to set own agenda, speaking engagements accelerate"

  career_phase_3:
    period: "2013-present"
    label: "HIBP Era"
    description: "Have I Been Pwned launched December 2013, becomes defining project"
    rhythm: "Breach-driven cadence overlaid on content creation and speaking"
    evolution:
      - "2013-2017: Solo operation, building HIBP while maintaining content output"
      - "2017-2019: Explored selling HIBP, ultimately decided against"
      - "2019-2021: Partnered with Cloudflare, FBI integration, scale growth"
      - "2021-present: HIBP as established institution, .NET Foundation board"
    pattern: >
      Each phase expanded Troy's reach while maintaining the core rhythms
      (blog, speaking, breach processing). The consistency of output across
      dramatically different life circumstances is the defining pattern.

  personal_life_arc:
    divorce:
      period: "Approximately 2017-2019"
      impact_on_routine: >
        Troy has been transparent about the divorce disrupting his life.
        Notably, the Weekly Update streak did NOT break. The blog continued.
        Work became both refuge and constant. The routine survived the
        personal upheaval — suggesting it is identity, not discipline.
    recovery:
      pattern: "Rebuilt personal life in Gold Coast, new relationship (Charlotte)"
      integration: "Partner became part of the public narrative in a healthy way"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CONTENT REPURPOSING PIPELINE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
content_pipeline:

  description: >
    Troy has an efficient content multiplication system where a single
    insight or investigation generates value across multiple formats.

  pipeline_flow:
    step_1:
      format: "Blog post"
      description: "Original long-form investigation or analysis"
      effort: "Highest — original research, writing, screenshots"
    step_2:
      format: "Weekly Update mention"
      description: "Discussed in the video with additional commentary"
      effort: "Low — leverages existing knowledge"
    step_3:
      format: "Conference talk"
      description: "Key stories and insights packaged into presentations"
      effort: "Medium — narrative restructured for live audience"
    step_4:
      format: "Pluralsight course"
      description: "Concepts systematized into structured curriculum"
      effort: "High — but built on existing knowledge base"
    step_5:
      format: "Workshop (Hack Yourself First)"
      description: "Hands-on teaching derived from all of the above"
      effort: "Medium — framework exists, content refreshed"

  efficiency_insight: >
    Troy rarely creates content from scratch for a single purpose. Every
    breach investigation, every security observation, every personal
    experience is raw material that flows through multiple output channels.
    This is not lazy recycling — each format adds unique value. But the
    underlying research is done once and leveraged many times.

# ROUTINE RESILIENCE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
resilience_analysis:

  what_never_breaks:
    - "Weekly Update publication"
    - "Breach data processing and HIBP maintenance"
    - "Daily exercise"
    - "Social media engagement"

  what_flexes:
    - "Blog post frequency (varies with available time and events)"
    - "Course production (pauses during heavy travel)"
    - "Sleep schedule (compressed during crunch periods)"
    - "Personal leisure time (first casualty of high demand)"

  sustaining_mechanisms:
    intrinsic_motivation: >
      Troy genuinely enjoys the work. Breach investigation is intellectually
      stimulating. Writing is satisfying. Speaking is energizing. The routine
      sustains because it is built on authentic interest, not forced discipline.
    identity_fusion: >
      Troy Hunt IS the person who writes about security and runs HIBP.
      The routine is not something he does — it is who he is. This makes
      consistency effortless in the same way breathing is effortless.
    environmental_design: >
      Gold Coast provides the physical reset (beach, weather, outdoor
      activities) that makes the intense work sustainable. The location
      is not accidental — it is infrastructure for the lifestyle.
