      name: "The Pwned Protector"
      description: "The world's #1 data breach expert got phished himself."
      resolution: "Rather than hide, published within 34 minutes and loaded own breach into HIBP."

      description: "Turned down millions from 141 companies to keep HIBP free and independent."
      resolution: "'I've never been so happy to have lost so much.' Values > money."
      depth: "Financial sacrifice as values expression. The richest version of Troy is the one on the jet ski, not the one with the acquisition check."

        - "11-month M&A process abandoned"
        - "HIBP has no ads, no paywalls"

      description: "'I don't see anything changing' — yet publishes weekly, speaks at conferences, loads breaches."
      resolution: "Sees no macro progress but does micro-progress every single day."
      depth: "The Sisyphus of cybersecurity who somehow smiles while pushing the boulder. Motivation comes from individual impact, not systemic hope."
      behavioral_evidence:
        - "Weekly updates for 10+ years without stopping"
        - "Pessimistic industry assessments in same breath as actionable advice"

      resolution: "Uses personal pain as public pedagogy — vulnerability as strategic teaching tool."
