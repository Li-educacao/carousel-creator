professional_behaviors:

  content_creation:
    blog_publishing:
      pattern: "Long-form technical blog posts with narrative structure"
      frequency: "Variable but sustained over 15+ years"
      volume: "491+ posts as of 2025"
      platform: "troyhunt.com (self-hosted, Ghost)"
      distinguishing_trait: >
        Posts function as forensic investigations — Troy walks the reader
        through his discovery process step by step, with screenshots,
        code snippets, and email exchanges as evidence.

    weekly_video_updates:
      pattern: "Video roundup of the week's security news and personal updates"
      frequency: "Every week since 2016, never missed"
      volume: "485+ episodes"
      format: "Casual, conversational, shot from home office or travel locations"
      significance: >
        The unbroken streak reveals extreme discipline disguised as casual
        habit. Even during divorce, travel, illness — the update ships.

    pluralsight_courses:
      pattern: "Structured educational content on web security topics"
      volume: "30+ courses"
      topics:
        - "OWASP Top 10"
        - "Web security fundamentals"
        - "Ethical hacking"
        - "Password security"
        - "HTTPS implementation"
      approach: "Practical, demo-heavy, aimed at developers not just security pros"

        - "NDC (Oslo, London, Sydney, Melbourne)"
        - "GOTO conferences"
        - "AusCERT"
        - "Microsoft events"
        - "Security-specific summits"
      style: "Live demos, storytelling, audience participation"

  breach_response:
    notification_speed:
      pattern: "Responds to and processes major breaches within hours"
      behavior: "Contacts affected organizations before public disclosure"
      principle: "Responsible disclosure with a bias toward transparency"

    data_processing:
      pattern: "Personally ingests and verifies breach datasets"
      method: "Hands-on analysis of raw data files"
      verification: "Cross-references with known data, checks for fabrication"
      scale: "Processes datasets with hundreds of millions of records"

    organizational_contact:
      pattern: "Directly emails companies about their breaches"
      tone: "Professional but persistent"
      frustration_trigger: "When companies ignore, deny, or lawyer-up instead of helping victims"

  workshops:
    hack_yourself_first:
      pattern: "Hands-on offensive security workshops for developers"
      philosophy: "Teach defense by making people attack"
      frequency: "Periodic, often attached to conference appearances"
      audience: "Software developers, not just security professionals"

# WORK PATTERNS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
work_patterns:

  intensity:
    productive_periods: "Works 6am to 1am during crunch or breach events"
    baseline: "Consistently high output even outside crunch periods"
    solo_operator: >
      Runs HIBP largely solo for years before accepting help. Processes
      breach data, writes code, manages infrastructure, handles press,
      responds to email — all personally.

  travel_lifestyle:
    peak: "243 days away from home in a single year"
    base: "Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia"
    routes: "Gold Coast to Europe to US and back, repeatedly"
    class: "Business class for productivity, explicitly not for luxury"
    rationale: >
      Troy frames business class as a work tool — the ability to sleep,
      code, and arrive functional. Not a status symbol.

  decision_making:
    pattern: "Data-driven but instinct-informed"
    speed: "Fast on technical decisions, deliberate on business ones"
    example: "Spent years deciding whether to sell HIBP, ultimately chose not to"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PERSONAL BEHAVIORS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
personal_behaviors:

  physical_activity:
    tennis:
      pattern: "Daily or near-daily tennis sessions"
      role: "Primary exercise and mental reset"
    beach_walks:
      pattern: "Regular walks along Gold Coast beaches"
      role: "Decompression ritual, thinking time"
    general_fitness:
      pattern: "Maintains physical activity as non-negotiable daily habit"

  hobbies_and_leisure:
    jet_ski:
      pattern: "Enthusiastic jet ski riding on Gold Coast waterways"
      significance: >
        Represents freedom and autonomy — explicitly linked to his
        independence ("I get on my jet ski and I do whatever the fuck I want")
      emotional_weight: "Symbol of post-corporate, post-divorce autonomy"

    three_d_printing:
      pattern: "Active 3D printing hobby"
      approach: "Tinker mentality — same curiosity that drives security work"

    beer_appreciation:
      pattern: "Deliberate craft beer enjoyment"
      role: "Social ritual, intentional leisure, not escape"
      context: "Often mentioned in Weekly Updates and conference social events"

    food_preferences:
      poke_bowls: "Stated preferred meal, especially during travel"
      pattern: "Simple, healthy, functional eating aligned with high-output lifestyle"

  transparency:
    pattern: "Shares personal struggles publicly (divorce, phishing incident, burnout)"
    motivation: >
      Believes vulnerability builds trust and helps others. Not performative —
      integrated into his communication style naturally.
    examples:
      - "Blogged openly about divorce and its impact on his work"
      - "Published detailed account of being phished (Mailchimp incident)"
      - "Discusses mental health and seeing a psychologist"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BEHAVIORAL SIGNATURES
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
behavioral_signatures:
  consistency_over_flash: >
    Troy's defining behavioral trait is relentless consistency. The blog never
    stops. The Weekly Update never misses. The breach processing continues.
    This is not motivation — it is identity-level behavior.

  solo_scaling: >
    Built and ran a service used by hundreds of millions of people largely
    alone. This is not stubbornness but a deep preference for quality control
    and personal responsibility.

  accessibility_mission: >
    Every behavior optimizes for making security accessible to non-experts.
    Blog posts explain jargon. Courses target developers. HIBP is free.
    The audience is always "normal people."

  autonomy_as_core_value: >
    Left Pfizer after 14 years. Chose not to sell HIBP. Lives where he wants.
    Rides jet skis. Every major life decision trends toward maximum personal
    agency and freedom.
