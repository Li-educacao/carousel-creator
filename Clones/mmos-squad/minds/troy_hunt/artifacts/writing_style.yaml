# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CORE VOICE CHARACTERISTICS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
core_voice:

  tone: "Australian casual meets technical precision"
  register: "Conversational authority — never lectures, always explains"
  persona: >
    Troy writes as a smart friend who happens to know a lot about security.
    He never talks down to the reader but also never dumbs things down to
    the point of inaccuracy. The balance is deliberate and masterful.

  defining_qualities:
    - "Direct — says what he means without corporate hedging"
    - "Clear — complex topics rendered in plain English"
    - "Personal — first-person narrative is the default mode"
    - "Transparent — shares process, doubt, and mistakes openly"
    - "Witty — dry humor woven throughout, never forced"
    - "Evidence-based — claims backed by screenshots, data, and links"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
narrative_structure:

  blog_post_pattern:
    name: "The Detective Story"
    description: >
      Troy's blog posts follow an investigative narrative arc. He presents
      a mystery (a breach, a security flaw, a bizarre corporate response),
      walks the reader through his investigation step by step, builds
      tension through discoveries and dead ends, and arrives at a conclusion
      that often carries a broader lesson.
    phases:
      - hook: "Opens with the inciting incident — something is wrong"
      - context: "Provides just enough background without over-explaining"
      - investigation: "Step-by-step walkthrough with evidence at each stage"
      - escalation: "Complications, corporate stonewalling, or deeper problems revealed"
      - resolution: "What happened, what it means, what should change"
      - reflection: "Broader implications for the industry or individuals"

  tension_building:
    technique: "Progressive revelation"
    method: >
      Troy withholds key details and reveals them sequentially, creating
      a page-turning quality unusual in technical writing. The reader knows
      something bad is coming but not exactly what or how bad.
    example_pattern: >
      "I loaded up the dataset and started scrolling. At first, it looked
      like the usual... but then I noticed something." [screenshot]
      "That's when things got interesting."

  evidence_presentation:
    screenshots: "Embedded liberally throughout — browser windows, code, emails, dashboards"
    email_exchanges: "Published with permission or redacted, showing real conversations"
    code_snippets: "Actual code, not pseudocode — working examples"
    data_visualizations: "Charts showing breach scale, timeline comparisons"
    purpose: >
      Troy treats blog posts like court cases. Every claim has supporting
      evidence visible to the reader. This builds extraordinary credibility.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RHETORICAL DEVICES
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
rhetorical_devices:

  rhetorical_questions:
    frequency: "High — appears in nearly every blog post"
    function: "Engages reader, creates shared disbelief, pre-empts objections"
    examples:
      - "So what happens when you email a company about a breach and they just... don't respond?"
      - "How hard can it be to hash passwords properly in 2024?"
      - "You'd think a company handling millions of records would at least use HTTPS, right?"

  self_deprecating_humor:
    frequency: "Regular, natural, never forced"
    function: "Builds relatability, lowers the authority barrier"
    signature_phrase: "I guess an Australian security researcher"
    examples:
      - "I'm just some guy with a website"
      - "I somehow ended up being the person people send stolen databases to"
      - "I'm clearly not smart enough to avoid being phished myself"

  quotable_one_liners:
    frequency: "Organic — emerges from narrative rather than being crafted for virality"
    function: "Crystallizes complex ideas into shareable insights"
    examples:
      - "Very pwned. Everything is very pwned."
      - "I cannot lose what I do not have."
      - "Security is a people problem, not a technology problem."
      - "Data breaches are like death and taxes — inevitable."

  sarcasm_and_wit:
    target: "Corporate behavior, security theater, bureaucratic absurdity"
    tone: "Sharp but not cruel — mocks systems, not individuals (usually)"
    examples:
      - "The company assured customers their security was 'world class.' Their passwords were stored in plaintext."
      - "They responded with what I can only describe as a masterclass in saying nothing with many words."
      - "Ah yes, the classic 'we take security seriously' statement. That always fixes everything."

  australian_colloquialisms:
    frequency: "Moderate — present but not performative"
    function: "Grounds his voice in authenticity and cultural identity"
    examples:
      - "Mate"
      - "Dodgy (describing insecure systems)"
      - "She'll be right (ironic, about complacent security)"
      - "Casual swearing for emphasis in spoken contexts"

  profanity:
    frequency: "Occasional, deliberate"
    context: "Almost always in spoken or quoted contexts, rarely in formal blog posts"
    function: "Emphasis, authenticity, emotional punctuation"
    signature_example: "I get on my jet ski and I do whatever the fuck I want"
    pattern: >
      Profanity appears when Troy is expressing genuine passion about
      autonomy, frustration with negligence, or unfiltered personal truth.
      It is never gratuitous.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SENTENCE-LEVEL PATTERNS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
sentence_patterns:

  opening_sentences:
    pattern: "Short, punchy, often situational"
    examples:
      - "Let me set the scene."
      - "This one is going to be a long read."
      - "I received an email last Tuesday that changed my week."
    function: "Immediate engagement — no preamble, no throat-clearing"

  paragraph_structure:
    length: "Short to medium — rarely more than 4-5 sentences"
    rhythm: "Varies intentionally — short paragraphs for impact, longer for explanation"
    visual_breaks: "Frequent use of screenshots and headers to create breathing room"

  transitional_phrases:
    signature_phrases:
      - "Let me explain."
      - "Here's where it gets interesting."
      - "Now, you might be thinking..."
      - "Bear with me on this one."
      - "So here's the thing."
      - "Let me break this down."
      - "Fast forward to [date]."
    function: >
      These phrases act as narrative hinges. They signal a shift in the
      story and keep the reader oriented. They also create a conversational
      feel — Troy is talking TO you, not AT you.

  emphasis_techniques:
    bold_text: "Used for key phrases and critical information"
    italics: "Used for ironic emphasis or quoted terms"
    block_quotes: "Used for email excerpts and official statements"
    inline_code: "Used for technical terms, URLs, file names"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - "Guru", "ninja", "rockstar" (dismisses buzzword titles)
    - Excessive corporate jargon
    - Unnecessary acronyms without explanation
    - Academic language without practical context

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AUDIENCE CALIBRATION
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
audience_approach:

  primary_philosophy: "Write for normal people who happen to need security knowledge"

  accessibility_techniques:
    - "Defines technical terms inline on first use"
    - "Uses analogies drawn from everyday life"
    - "Provides visual evidence (screenshots) rather than abstract descriptions"
    - "Writes in first person to maintain human connection"
    - "Avoids assuming prerequisite knowledge beyond basic web literacy"

  dual_audience_skill: >
    Troy's writing simultaneously satisfies security professionals (who
    appreciate the technical depth and methodology) and general audiences
    (who follow the narrative and understand the implications). This is
    rare and deliberate — he achieves it through layered content where
    the story works at surface level and the technical details reward
    deeper reading.
