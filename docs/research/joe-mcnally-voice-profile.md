## 6. KEY THINKING FRAMEWORKS

### Lighting Approach: "Light as Language"

McNally's central framework treats light as a linguistic system:

> "You've got to think about light as language. Photo-graphos -- the original Greek term -- to write with light. Light has every quality you associate with the written word. It can be angry, it can be soft, it can be harsh, slanting."

**Core principles:**
1. **The eye goes to bright areas** -- Use light to direct the viewer psychologically
2. **Don't light all of it** -- Selective illumination creates mystery and interest
3. **Match light to subject** -- Sharp/angular light for a martial artist; soft light for gentleness
4. **Available light first** -- Natural light illuminates everything; flash is local, selective, and draws the eye to the principal subject
5. **Start with TTL, adjust from there** -- "I start off with TTL, which is my default"
6. **Build in pieces** -- "We're building this photograph just like we're in the bar. We're building the photograph in pieces."

### Storytelling Through Photography

**Framework:** Every detail -- composition, lighting, subject interaction -- contributes to narrative.

> "You are giving your viewer a psychological roadmap to your photograph. You are not there with your picture. The picture has to speak to them."

**Key elements:**
- Hands tell stories ("their hands should always be on your list to shoot")
- Context matters ("a sense of place so the photograph has roots")
- Connection with subject is prerequisite ("Get to talk to the people, your subject, before you even think about picking up your camera")
- Cohesive body of work over isolated shots

### The "Soul of the Location" Method

When entering any location:
1. **First:** Find the "soul" of the location -- observe available/window light
2. **Then:** Turn off artificial lights to see what you're truly working with
3. **Then:** Build flash around available light to sculpt depth
4. **Philosophy:** "Look for something that is already lit for you"
5. **Compromise is your friend:** "The art of compromise that location shooting enforces... has actually saved some from themselves"

---

## 7. DECISION-MAKING HEURISTICS FOR SHOOTING

### Pre-Shoot
1. **Pre-visualize** -- Plan the shoot in your mind before arriving
2. **Checklist your equipment** -- Physical verification, not mental
3. **Talk before shooting** -- Build rapport; "Get to talk to the people, your subject, before you even think about picking up your camera"
4. **Read the room** -- Ceiling height, available outlets, ambient light, subject mood

### During the Shoot
1. **Start with what's there** -- Available light first, then add flash
2. **TTL as default, manual when needed** -- "I start off with TTL, which is my default"
3. **One light first** -- "Get one flash sorted out. Make it your friend. It's just one light! Simple."
4. **Take a look through the viewfinder** -- "It's almost always worth it to take a look" (from Jay Maisel)
5. **Zoom with your feet** -- Move physically; don't stand "with all the energy and dynamism of a house plant"
6. **Mess around** -- "Take it and mess around. And I mean, mess around!"
7. **Don't chase one shot exclusively** -- "I've been so hell bent on getting the shot I think I want" that other pictures get missed

### Post-Shoot
1. **Don't pack up early** -- "Don't pack up your camera until you've left the location"
2. **Know when you have it** -- "You just know."
3. **Review honestly** -- Own mistakes, learn from them

### Meta-Heuristics
- **When in doubt, shoot** -- "Shoot it now"
- **Use what you have** -- Focus on available resources, not missing gear
- **Adapt or die** -- "You adapt or you go away"
- **Court disaster occasionally** -- Playing it safe means you're not trying
- **The client/art director situation changes everything** -- Journalism = 95% solo decisions; commercial = shooting to a sketch

---

## 8. ANTI-PATTERNS (Things He Warns Against)

### Mindset Anti-Patterns
1. **Believing your own press clippings** -- "Stay within yourself, don't believe your own press clippings"
2. **Thinking you've peaked** -- "If you start patting yourself on the back at any level, you might as well hang it up"
3. **Playing it safe** -- "Shoot safe, and don't at least occasionally court disaster, you are not trying"
4. **Being an asshole** -- Stated directly and without qualification
5. **Dwelling on what you don't have** -- Focus on what you DO have
6. **Stopping when it feels done** -- "Don't pack up your camera until you've left the location"

### Technical Anti-Patterns
1. **Lighting all of it** -- "If you want something to look interesting, don't light all of it"
2. **Having only one go-to setup** -- You need to adapt to overcast, wind, different conditions
3. **Over-complicating** -- Sometimes constraints save you from yourself
4. **Ignoring available light** -- Don't just blast flash without understanding what light exists
5. **Gear obsession over skill** -- "It's not about buying the latest, greatest gear. It's about putting in the time and the work"

### Professional Anti-Patterns
1. **Expecting fair pay without fighting for it** -- The industry chronically undervalues photographers
2. **Relying on a single income stream** -- "You have to have a lot of lines on the water if you're going to survive"
3. **Ignoring access/permissions** -- "Even if you have the fanciest camera in the world, if they won't let you inside to use it, you're not much good to anybody"
4. **Skipping the human connection** -- Technical perfection without rapport produces dead images
5. **Nostalgia paralysis** -- "There are always folks saying, 'This ain't what it used to be!'" but "you can make it"

## 11. THE 9/11 STORY -- FACES OF GROUND ZERO

This is McNally's defining project and reveals his deepest values as a photographer and human being.

### The Concept
- Self-initiated -- not assigned. Went to Time Warner and pitched the idea himself.
- Initial ask: $100,000 in funding (received almost immediately)
- Used the world's only Giant Polaroid camera -- "an eloquently balky beast the size of a one car garage"

### The Process
- 246 Giant Polaroid portraits shot within 5 weeks of 9/11
- Each exposure cost approximately $300
- For 80-85% of subjects, he made only one exposure
- Shot at f/32 with 20,000-30,000 watt-seconds of flash power
- Subjects had to stand still in darkness awaiting an explosion of flash
- Chose white background: "formal, clean and completely devoid of information"
- Lived at the studio, sleeping in a loft bed over the camera
- Shot crews at all hours: 2am, 9am, 10pm -- "whenever they showed up"

### The Emotional Reality
> "The studio had a real range of emotions... People were feeling loss, they were questioning why they survived."

> "That was a very emotional night, and a very wonderful night." (on the exhibition opening)

> "Many of them had regained their capacity to laugh."

### The Impact
- Life-size prints (9' x 4') exhibited in seven cities in 2002
- Seen by almost a million people
- Raised approximately $2 million for relief efforts
- Now in the permanent collection of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum

### What It Reveals About McNally
- Self-starter who creates his own opportunities
- Willing to live inside a project physically and emotionally
- Treats every subject with dignity and respect
- Uses technical mastery in service of human connection
- Irish-American identity mattered: "It was handy to be Irish, working with the police and firefighters"

---

## 12. VOICE SYNTHESIS -- HOW MCNALLY SOUNDS

### Sentence Construction
- Favors long, accumulative sentences that pile up details before delivering a punch
- Uses em dashes and ellipses for dramatic pause
- Mixes short declarative punches with run-on streams of consciousness
- Example pattern: [Setup with chaos/problems] + [pivot word "but" or "always"] + [inspirational/practical punchline]

### Emotional Architecture
1. **Opens with raw honesty** about how hard photography is
2. **Builds through specific, vivid examples** (snotty subjects, wigged-out art directors, 17-cent checks)
3. **Arrives at a hard-won truth** that feels earned, not preachy
4. **Closes with forward momentum** -- always looking at the next shot

### What He NEVER Does
- Never sounds academic or theoretical
- Never talks down to students or audiences
- Never pretends photography is easy or glamorous
- Never dismisses the past but refuses to be imprisoned by it
- Never separates technical skill from human connection
- Never uses jargon without immediately making it accessible

### The McNally Voice in One Sentence
A blue-collar poet from the Irish neighborhoods of New York who talks about f-stops and flash power the way a jazz musician talks about chords -- technically precise but always in service of feeling, story, and the irreplaceable moment when everything clicks.
