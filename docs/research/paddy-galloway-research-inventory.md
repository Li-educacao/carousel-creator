## Core Frameworks and Methodologies

### 1. CCN Framework (Core, Casual, New)

The audience segmentation model that underpins all of Paddy's strategy work:
- **Core viewers** -- Loyal fans who watch everything. They care deeply about the niche.
- **Casual viewers** -- Dip in and out of the niche. Somewhat interested but not hardcore.
- **New viewers** -- Have never watched the channel before. Will click if something looks interesting.

**Key insight:** Viral videos hit all three segments. Most creators only serve Core. The goal is to expand to Casual and New without alienating Core.

### 2. The Idea-First Philosophy

> "The idea sets the ceiling, the execution determines the result."

- Pre-production (idea, title, thumbnail, hook) matters MORE than filming or editing
- A 20% better title can drastically increase views
- Spend more time planning than producing

### 3. The 0-100-10-1 Content Strategy

Systematic idea generation framework:
1. **0** -- Start from zero assumptions
2. **100** -- Force yourself to brainstorm 100 video ideas (most will be bad)
3. **10** -- Filter down to 10 strong candidates
4. **1** -- Develop 1 final concept to produce

### 4. The 3-Phase Consulting Playbook

Results: 350% and 500% view increases for agency clients.

**Phase 1 -- Foundation:**
- Ensure correct team members in place
- Research the niche to identify outlier ideas
- Analyze client's channel data
- Establish vision for editing style, thumbnail style, and channel tone

**Phase 2 -- Experimentation:**
- Use research insights to brainstorm 100+ ideas
- Pick 5 to test
- Test new thumbnail and editing changes

**Phase 3 -- Growth:**
- Double down on 1-3 content buckets that are working
- Brainstorm more within proven formats
- Scale what works

### 5. The 12-Step Process (Build a Channel in 12 Months)

Organized in 3 phases:

**Phase 1 -- Establishment:**
- Step 1: Find niche using Triple Venn Diagram (passion + skill + market demand)
- Study YouTube several hours daily with other creator friends
- Learn editing and storytelling yourself
- Post 2 videos/week initially

**Phase 2 -- Improvements:**
- At 16 weeks, switch to 1 video/week (same effort as 2)
- A/B test thumbnails
- Apply lessons from each video to the next

**Phase 3 -- Optimization:**
- After 12 months: 60+ videos, refined workflow
- Examine and learn from every piece of content
- Build toward repeatable formats

### 6. Clickbait Theory

The science of ethical click-inducing thumbnails and titles:
- Combine simplicity and exaggeration without crossing the line
- Use bright colors (60-70% watch in dark mode)
- 3 or fewer elements in thumbnails
- Complement the title while teasing the story
- Power words ("Broke," "Beat") highlighted for emphasis
- Create 10-20 thumbnail and title variations per video
- A/B test with tools like TubeBuddy

### 7. Retention Mapping

- Study retention curves obsessively
- The first second is critical ("Treat your intro like a thumbnail")
- Jump straight into the narrative -- no unnecessary context
- Lead with strongest content
- Establish viewer stakes early
- Strategic questions create curiosity ("What does MrBeast know that we don't?")

### 8. Video Quality Formula

> Production value + quality idea + storytelling + effort shown

### 9. Ethical Stealing Framework

How to take inspiration without being a copycat:
- Study the 5-6 best performing videos on a topic
- Identify key elements that make them successful
- Take elements and put your own twist on them
- Cross-niche inspiration is encouraged (study viral content beyond your niche)

### 10. The Elephant (Storytelling Concept)

Referenced in The Editing Podcast interview -- a storytelling framework for structuring YouTube content with satisfying narrative arcs.

### 11. Forbes 3 Lessons

1. Study your niche while innovating it
2. Master your word choice -- lead with tangible numbers, not fluff
3. Don't let niche limitations be an excuse -- deeply understand target audience

### 12. 29 Lessons (Birthday Thread, 2025)

Key highlights from his "turned 29" reflection thread:
- If starting from 0, have a 2-year horizon of consistent posting and improvement
- 90%+ of growth comes from ONE idea
- Great channels are built on turning one outlier idea into a repeatable format
- Don't overthink analysis -- action over talking
- 99% of your time should be on action, not talking about how much you know
